# FHOPS CLI Profiles

This document centralises the design and behaviour of FHOPS CLI configuration
profiles. It replaces ad-hoc notes in `notes/cli_profiles_plan.md` and should
be treated as the authoritative specification for profile names, defaults, and
expected outputs.

Status: draft (extracted from `notes/cli_profiles_plan.md`).
