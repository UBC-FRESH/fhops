# FHOPS v1.0.0-alpha1

## Summary
- First tagged alpha that **completes every Phase 1–4 roadmap milestone** aside from outreach.
- Adds the Phase 4 documentation suite:
  - Thesis evaluation playbook (`docs/howto/thesis_eval.rst`)
  - Telemetry operations runbook (`docs/howto/telemetry_ops.rst`)
  - Release & contribution playbook (`docs/howto/release_playbook.rst`)
  - API narrative guides tying Scenario → Optimisation → Evaluation modules together.
- History rewrite removed the private `coding-agent-conversation-log.txt.bak` backup so no secrets leak.
- Ready for Rosalia Jaffray’s MASc Chapter 2 experiments and internal BC deployment pilots.

## Installation
```bash
pip install fhops==1.0.0a1

# Development / verification
pip install hatch
hatch run dev:suite
```

## Highlights
- Documentation: all how-tos refreshed, API pages now include contextual snippets, telemetry + release ops playbooks added.
- Roadmap: Phase 2 shift scheduling, mobilisation, sequencing, and benchmarking tasks all green; Phase 3 analytics/telemetry shipped.
- Release hygiene: formal release notes live under `docs/releases/`, changelog enforced via pre-commit, release workflow scripted via Hatch.

## Known Issues / Next Steps
- Outreach plan (blog announcement, seminars) still open on the roadmap.
- Agentic tuner and DSS/ArcGIS integrations remain in the backlog; continue tracking in `notes/metaheuristic_hyperparam_tuning.md`.
- Weekly “full” analytics CI job is documented but still queued for automation.

## Verification
- `hatch run dev:suite`
- `sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html -W`
- `scripts/run_analytics_notebooks.py --light`
- `HATCH_INDEX=pypi hatch publish` (PyPI upload)
