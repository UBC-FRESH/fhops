# FHOPS v1.0.0-alpha2

## Summary
- Locks in the docstring overhaul: every public CLI command, productivity helper, heuristic driver, and playback adapter now publishes full parameter/return semantics so Sphinx autodoc mirrors the CLI UX.
- Hardens Typer-based tests by merging stdout/stderr, stripping ANSI noise, and providing shared helpers (`tests/cli.py`, `fhops._typer_cli_runner.patch_typer_cli_runner`) so Rich error banners never break assertions again.
- Polishes costing/telemetry docs (inflation helpers, harvest-system reference tables, release/ops playbooks) and expands the planning notes so ROSI’s MASc thesis workflow can cite authoritative references.
- Keeps release hygiene tight: changelog hook understands merge commits, the notes tree stays out of PyPI, and doc builds/tests run clean before tagging.

## Installation
```bash
pip install fhops==1.0.0a2

# Development / verification
pip install hatch
hatch run dev:suite
```

## Highlights
- **Docstrings & Sphinx** – CLI dataset prompts, heuristic registries, playback exporters, and productivity estimators all expose NumPy-style docstrings (sections for parameters, returns, units, citations). API reference pages now render the same level of detail as the CLI hints.
- **CLI reliability** – Tests import `tests.cli.CliRunner`/`cli_text`, ensuring Typer stderr is mirrored into stdout_bytes and ANSI escapes are removed before assertions. This keeps the Rich-powered error banners usable in both CI and local terminals.
- **Costing + inflation docs** – `fhops.costing.machine_rates`/`inflation` helpers now include docstrings that describe CPI baselines, units, and return schemas; `docs/reference/harvest_systems.rst` pulls the same data to cross-link presets with machine roles.
- **Tooling polish** – The changelog hook understands merge commits (and gracefully skips shallow CI clones), so tagged releases can land without manual overrides; `notes/` remains excluded from wheels/sdists.

## Known Issues / Next Steps
- Outreach tasks (blog, seminars) remain open on the roadmap.
- Agentic tuner integrations (ArcGIS/DSS connectors) and the full telemetry automation job are still tracked in `notes/metaheuristic_hyperparam_tuning.md` and the roadmap.
- Shift-based scheduling refactor remains scoped in `notes/modular_reorg_plan.md`; continue executing the checklist before beta.

## Verification
- `hatch run dev:suite`
- `sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html -W`
- `pre-commit run --all-files`
- `HATCH_INDEX=pypi hatch publish`
