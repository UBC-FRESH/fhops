CLI Reference
=============

FHOPS exposes a Typer-based CLI called ``fhops``. Detailed command documentation will be
autogenerated with ``sphinx-click`` in upcoming iterations. For now, the primary commands are:

- ``fhops validate`` — validate scenario inputs.
- ``fhops solve-mip`` — build and solve the deterministic MIP.
- ``fhops solve-heur`` — run the metaheuristic solver (simulated annealing v0.1).
- ``fhops evaluate`` — replay a schedule and compute KPIs.
- ``fhops benchmark`` — compare solver runtimes and quality on a scenario.

Run ``fhops --help`` to inspect the full command tree.
