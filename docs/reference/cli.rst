CLI Reference
=============

FHOPS exposes a Typer-based CLI called ``fhops``. Detailed command documentation will be
autogenerated with ``sphinx-click`` in upcoming iterations. For now, the primary commands are:

- ``fhops validate`` — validate scenario inputs.
- ``fhops solve-mip`` — build and solve the deterministic MIP.
- ``fhops solve-heur`` — run the metaheuristic solver (simulated annealing v0.1).
- ``fhops evaluate`` — replay a schedule and compute KPIs.
- ``fhops benchmark`` — compare solver runtimes and quality on a scenario.

Run ``fhops --help`` to inspect the full command tree.

Baseline usage:

- ``fhops solve-mip tests/fixtures/regression/regression.yaml --out /tmp/regression_mip.csv``
- ``fhops solve-heur tests/fixtures/regression/regression.yaml --out /tmp/regression_sa.csv``
- ``fhops evaluate tests/fixtures/regression/regression.yaml /tmp/regression_sa.csv``

The evaluation output should include `mobilisation_cost=6.0` and `sequencing_violation_count=0`
if the regression baseline is satisfied.
