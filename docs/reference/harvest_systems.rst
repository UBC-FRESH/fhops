Harvest System Registry
=======================

FHOPS ships with a typed registry describing commonly-used harvest systems. Each system lists the
ordered jobs, required machine roles, and precedence relationships; solver components and data
contracts rely on this metadata to enforce sequencing constraints.

Data Model
----------

Harvest systems live under :mod:`fhops.scheduling.systems.models` and are represented by two
dataclasses:

``SystemJob``
    Defined by ``name``, ``machine_role``, and a list of prerequisite job names.
``HarvestSystem``
    Holds ``system_id``, ordered ``jobs``, and optional ``environment`` / ``notes`` metadata.

The helper :func:`fhops.scheduling.systems.models.default_system_registry` returns the built-in
collection summarised below.

Default Systems
---------------

     - Standing skyline with chokers feeding landing processing.
   * - ``cable_running``
     - cable-running skyline
     - hand/mech faller → grapple yarder → landing processor/hand buck → loader
     - Grapple yarder variant with landing finishing.
   * - ``helicopter``
     - helicopter
     - hand faller → helicopter longline → hand buck/processor → loader/water
     - Helicopter longline with on-landing processing or direct-to-water transfer.

Using the Registry
------------------

- Scenario contract: blocks may specify ``harvest_system_id``; the scenario definition can embed a
  ``harvest_systems`` map to override or extend the defaults (see
  :mod:`fhops.scenario.contract.models`).
- Synthetic generator: :func:`fhops.scenario.synthetic.generate_with_systems` assigns systems
  round-robin to blocks and creates matching machine role inventories.
- Solvers: sequencing constraints in the MIP and heuristics consume the registry to enforce job
  ordering and machine-role feasibility. Violations surface through KPI outputs and CLI summaries.

Extending Systems
-----------------

To define custom systems, construct :class:`HarvestSystem` instances and supply them via the scenario
contract. When adding optional or parallel tasks, document the intended precedence explicitly and
consider updating this reference alongside any new data files.

Forwarder Productivity Models
-----------------------------

Cut-to-length systems rely on the forwarder helper stack (``fhops.productivity.forwarder_bc``) when
``fhops dataset estimate-productivity`` or ``fhops dataset estimate-forwarder-productivity`` is invoked.
Pick the regression that matches the stand context:

* ``ghaffariyan-small`` / ``ghaffariyan-large`` – ALPACA plantation thinning data (14 t and 20 t
  forwarders). Requires ``--extraction-distance`` plus either ``--slope-class`` or
  ``--slope-factor``. Use these when analysing Australian-style commercial thinning or when you
  need quick distance/slope sensitivity without payload inputs.
* ``kellogg-sawlog`` / ``kellogg-pulpwood`` / ``kellogg-mixed`` – FMG 910 regression from
  Kellogg & Bettinger (1994) for western Oregon CTL operations. Supply ``--volume-per-load``,
  ``--distance-out``, ``--travel-in-unit``, and ``--distance-in``. Ideal for moderate (≤350 m)
  extraction distances and when you must distinguish sawlog vs. pulp payloads.
* ``adv6n10-shortwood`` – FPInnovations ADV6N10 shortwood model for boreal multi-product sorting.
  Requires ``--payload-per-trip``, ``--mean-log-length``, ``--travel-speed``, ``--trail-length``, and
  ``--products-per-trail``. Use this when you have explicit payload/log-length targets or need to
  quantify the productivity penalty of sorting several products per trail.
* ``eriksson-final-felling`` / ``eriksson-thinning`` – Eriksson & Lindroos (2014) Swedish follow-up
  dataset covering >700 CTL forwarders. Provide ``--mean-extraction-distance`` (m),
  ``--mean-stem-size`` (m³), and ``--load-capacity`` (m³). The final-felling variant reflects larger
  stems and long forwarding distances; the thinning variant should be used when stem sizes stay below
  ~0.2 m³. These regressions omit explicit slope factors, so treat steep ground as an open action item
  until BC-specific multipliers are published.
* ``laitila-vaatainen-brushwood`` – Ponsse Buffalo Dual harwarder regression from Laitila &
  Väätäinen (2020). Supply ``--harvested-trees-per-ha``, ``--avg-tree-volume-dm3``, and
  ``--forwarding-distance``. Optional knobs ``--harwarder-payload`` (default 7.1 m³) and
  ``--grapple-load-unloading`` (default 0.29 m³) match the study’s payload assumptions. This helper
  is best suited for whole-tree/brushwood clean-up, light salvage, or plantation corridor clearing
  where a single machine fells, accumulates, and shuttles material to the roadside.

The commands surface identical arguments under both the dedicated forwarder CLI and the general
``estimate-productivity --machine-role forwarder`` path, so the same guidance applies to synthetic
generators, scenario QA, and KPI workflows.

Grapple Skidder Productivity Models
-----------------------------------

Ground-based full-tree systems can now call the Han et al. (2018) regressions via
``fhops.dataset estimate-productivity --machine-role grapple_skidder``:

* ``han2018-lop-scatter`` – delay-free cycle time for Tigercat 615C skidding delimbed logs in
  lop-and-scatter salvage. Requires ``--skidder-pieces-per-cycle`` (logs/turn),
  ``--skidder-piece-volume`` (m³/log), ``--skidder-empty-distance`` (m), and
  ``--skidder-loaded-distance`` (m). Payload is derived automatically and converted into m³/PMH0.
* ``han2018-whole-tree`` – same machine/stand, but moving whole trees to roadside decks. Replace the
  log count with trees per turn (same CLI flag) and supply average tree volume.

Both helpers report cycle time, payload per turn, and predicted productivity so analysts can adjust
the distance or payload assumptions directly.

Trail spacing and decking multipliers (from FPInnovations TN285 and ADV4N21) can be applied via
``--skidder-trail-pattern`` (``narrow_13_15m`` | ``single_ghost_18m`` | ``double_ghost_27m``) and
``--skidder-decking-condition`` (``constrained_decking`` | ``prepared_decking``). The defaults follow
TN285’s finding that 13–15 m trail spacing drove 20–40% higher extraction costs (≈25% productivity
penalty) while double-ghost 27–30 m layouts serve as the baseline. ADV4N21 reported decking-time
reductions from 1.33 to 0.60 min/cycle after clearing the landing; we translate that ~16% cycle-time
penalty into the ``constrained_decking`` multiplier. Analysts can stack these with an optional
``--skidder-productivity-multiplier`` when site-specific data is available.

Harvest-system templates can now supply these overrides automatically: pass
``--harvest-system-id <system_id>`` (default registry or your scenario’s definitions) or
``--dataset <scenario-path> --block-id <block>`` to pull the block’s harvest system and apply its
``productivity_overrides`` for the grapple skidder job. The command prints when such defaults are
applied so you can verify which template influenced the result.

CTL Harvester Productivity Models
---------------------------------

``fhops.productivity.harvester_ctl`` hosts the shortwood harvester regressions. The inaugural entry is
the ADV6N10 single-grip model:

* ``adv6n10`` – Gingras & Favreau (2005) boreal multi-product study. Use when operators sort several
  products per pass and need visibility into harvester-side penalties. Required CLI flags:
  ``--ctl-stem-volume`` (m³/stem), ``--ctl-products-count`` (number of products sorted per cycle),
  ``--ctl-stems-per-cycle``, and ``--ctl-mean-log-length`` (m). Invoke via
  ``fhops dataset estimate-productivity --machine-role ctl_harvester`` to see the ADV6N10 result.
* ``adv5n30`` – Meek (2004) ADV5N30 Alberta white-spruce thinning. Provides removal-level
  productivity (30/50/70 %) plus an optional ``--ctl-brushed`` flag (adds the observed 21 % boost
  when brush crews pre-clear). Supply ``--ctl-removal-fraction`` (0–1 within the 0.30–0.70 window)
  to interpolate between the published removal levels.
* ``tn292`` – Bulley (1999) TN292 Alberta thinning (Kenmatt/Brinkman). Models harvester
  productivity versus tree size and stand density. Requires ``--ctl-stem-volume`` (m³/stem),
  ``--ctl-density`` (trees/ha), and ``--ctl-density-basis`` (``pre`` or ``post`` harvest) to match the
  published regressions.
