# Metadata Tables

SoftwareX requires two structured tables in the front matter:

1. **Code metadata** – repository URL, license, programming language, dependencies, documentation link, support contact, etc.
2. **Current code version** – software version identifier, permanent link/DOI, CI status, supported OS/architectures, key dependencies.

This folder stores the LaTeX snippets that render each table so they can be reused across the manuscript and any supplementary materials. Populate the placeholders inside `code_metadata.tex` and `current_code_version.tex` once the FHOPS release tag and artifact links are final.
