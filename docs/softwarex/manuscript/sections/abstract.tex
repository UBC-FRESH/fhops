Forest harvest operations planning still depends on bespoke optimisers, spreadsheet workflows, and undocumented heuristics, even though multiple surveys---including Rosalia Jaffray’s 2025 systematic review---have called for reusable tooling. FHOPS answers that gap by packaging the data contract, solver stack (Pyomo MIP plus SA/ILS/Tabu heuristics with Optuna-style tuning), and telemetry/evaluation services that we already run in production. Users can ingest curated British Columbia reference datasets or generate synthetic tiers, run benchmark or playback suites from a single command, and export the resulting tables/figures directly into both the SoftwareX manuscript and the FHOPS Sphinx documentation. Reproducibility is enforced via scripted asset generation (`make assets`) and a dedicated `make manuscript-benchmarks` target that logs commit IDs, runtimes, and SHA-256 fingerprints of the regenerated artifacts. This paper focuses on the open-source platform, while the forthcoming MASc thesis Chapter~2 retains the in-depth BC case studies (skyline, tethered, community forest). FHOPS therefore complements existing DSS initiatives (PRISM, lidar-enabled productivity models) by delivering an operations-layer workflow that can be audited, extended, and reused by practitioners and researchers alike.
