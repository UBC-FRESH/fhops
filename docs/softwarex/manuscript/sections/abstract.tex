Forest harvest operations planning still depends on bespoke optimisers, spreadsheet workflows, and undocumented heuristics, even though multiple surveys—including the 2025 systematic review by Jaffray et~al.—have called for reusable tooling. FHOPS answers that gap by packaging the data contract, solver stack (Pyomo MIP plus SA/ILS/Tabu heuristics with Optuna-style tuning), and telemetry/evaluation services that we already run in production. Users can ingest curated British Columbia reference datasets or generate synthetic tiers, run benchmark or playback suites from a single command, and export the resulting tables/figures directly into both this manuscript and the FHOPS Sphinx documentation. Reproducibility is enforced by the same scripted FHOPS pipeline that generates datasets, benchmarks, tuning studies, playback analyses, costing demonstrations, and scaling sweeps while logging commit IDs, runtimes, and SHA-256 fingerprints of the regenerated artifacts. The manuscript therefore scopes its contribution to the open-source platform while outlining how upcoming validation studies (e.g., skyline, helicopter, and ground-based deployments) will reuse the tooling without duplicating context-specific results here. FHOPS complements existing DSS initiatives (PRISM, lidar-enabled productivity models) by delivering an operations-layer workflow that can be audited, extended, and reused by practitioners and researchers alike.
