\section*{Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
  \item FHOPS delivers a full forest-harvest operations workflow (scenario contract, solver stack, telemetry) through a single CLI/API toolkit, providing the same reproducibility signals showcased by recent SoftwareX exemplars.
  \item A scripted asset pipeline (`make manuscript-benchmarks`) regenerates every dataset, benchmark, tuning study, playback analysis, costing demo, and scaling sweep while logging commit IDs, runtimes, and SHA-256 fingerprints for auditability.
  \item The manuscript scopes its contribution to the open-source platform and documents how forthcoming British Columbia validation studies will reuse the tooling without duplicating context-specific results here.
\end{itemize}
