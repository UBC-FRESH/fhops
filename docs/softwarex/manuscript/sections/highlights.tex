\section*{Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
  \item FHOPS packages the full forest-harvest operations workflow (scenario contract, solver stack, telemetry) into a single CLI/API toolkit that mirrors SoftwareX exemplars (PyLESA, pycity\_scheduling).
  \item A reproducible asset pipeline (`make manuscript-benchmarks`) regenerates all datasets, benchmarks, tuning studies, playback analyses, costing demos, and scaling sweeps, logging commit + hash evidence in-repo.
  \item The SoftwareX paper focuses on the open tooling while British Columbia case-study deployments stay in Rosalia Jaffray’s MASc Chapter~2, ensuring thesis alignment and future-ready reuse.
\end{itemize}
