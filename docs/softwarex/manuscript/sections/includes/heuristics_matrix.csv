"Simulated Annealing (SA)","balanced","Probabilistic move/swap neighbourhood with cooling schedule","Small-to-medium bundles needing quick feasible schedules","Use --sa-iters 2500+ for med42; --compare-preset diversify exposes swap-heavy exploration, while mobilisation preset biases toward distance-aware moves"
"SA (mobilisation preset)","mobilisation","Adds mobilisation_shake and higher landing penalties","Scenarios with tight landing caps or long walk thresholds","Pair with --compare-preset mobilisation plus lower --sa-iters to highlight mobilisation shake vs. default"
"Iterated Local Search (ILS)","ils_default","Deterministic restart loop wrapping greedy local search","Fine-tuning SA solutions on bounded horizons (<=150 assignments)","Expose --include-ils with ~400 iterations; set --ils-batch-neighbours 4 when CPU budget allows"
"Tabu Search","tabu_default","Short-term memory over swap/move neighbourhood","High-mobility cases (synthetic tier) where aggressive diversification helps","--tabu-iters 2500 plus automatic tenure delivered best synthetic_small runs; capture telemetry for objective trace"
