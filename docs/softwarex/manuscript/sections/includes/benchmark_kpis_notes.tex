The KPI roll-up highlights three solver behaviours we plan to discuss in
the manuscript:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{MiniToy}: ILS beats the SA baselines on objective (23
  vs.~15.5) with \textasciitilde3x faster runtime by focusing on the
  last-mile improvements. Tabu is competitive on runtime but falls short
  on assignments.
\item
  \textbf{Med42}: The large production penalty showcases why we need
  heuristics beyond SA---only ILS hits the negative objective targets
  expected from contraction penalties. The mobilisation preset surfaces
  the landing-limited behaviour we outline in the narrative.
\item
  \textbf{Synthetic tier}: All solvers converge to the same objective,
  but Tabu demonstrates the runtime floor (0.05 s) while SA presets show
  how mobilisation shakes affect runtime.
\end{itemize}

These shared tables let us cite numbers in both the SoftwareX paper and
the \texttt{howto/benchmarks} doc without copy/paste drift.
