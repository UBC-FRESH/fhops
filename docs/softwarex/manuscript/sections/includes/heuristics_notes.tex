FHOPS exposes the same metaheuristics benchmarked in the manuscript:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Simulated annealing} remains the default baseline
  (\texttt{bench\ suite} uses it unless disabled). The manuscript cites
  both the balanced preset (general-purpose) and the mobilisation preset
  (escapes landing-cap traps). Operator weights ship in
  \texttt{profiles.py}, so the exporter can surface them in the shared
  table.
\item
  \textbf{Iterated local search} is included to show deterministic
  improvement over SA in short horizons (e.g., tiny7). The solver
  piggybacks on SA assignments when \texttt{-\/-include-ils} is passed,
  reinforcing that end-users can reuse telemetry outputs.
\item
  \textbf{Tabu search} demonstrates diversification on synthetic
  bundles: objective traces show convergence parity with SA but at lower
  runtime. The manuscript will highlight how automatic tenure selection
  removes another tuning burden.
\end{itemize}

These notes accompany the shared \texttt{heuristics\_matrix.csv} so both
the PDF and Sphinx docs can present identical solver guidance.
