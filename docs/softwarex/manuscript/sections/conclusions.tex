\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

FHOPS translates a production-ready harvest-operations toolchain into a reproducible artifact. The manuscript demonstrates how the scenario contract, solver stack (Pyomo MIP plus SA/ILS/Tabu heuristics), and telemetry/playback services can be invoked via a single CLI/API workflow. Every figure and table (benchmarks, tuning leaderboards, playback robustness, scaling sweeps) now rebuilds from \texttt{make manuscript-benchmarks}, and the resulting artefacts—including the PRISMA workflow diagram—ship alongside the code so third parties can audit both the narrative and the underlying CSV/JSON records.

Future work focuses on broadening validation and extending the helper library. Rolling-horizon re-solving is the next major milestone: once med42 proves the plumbing, large84 will join the reproducibility tables with two concurrent harvest systems. The upcoming British Columbia deployments (ground-based CTL today, skyline/tethered/helicopter/salvage studies as those datasets thaw) will reuse the same automation pipeline to publish scenario bundles, solver runs, and KPI telemetry without duplicating tooling. On the modelling side we plan to flesh out forwarder/grapple-skidder productivity helpers (BC-adjusted AFORA/ALPACA regressions), add additional tuning profiles, and expand the synthetic generator so new harvest-system presets arrive with ready-made benchmark manifests (see \texttt{notes/softwarex\_manuscript\_change\_log.md}). Because these enhancements follow the same reproducibility hooks described here, subsequent FHOPS releases can cite a single artefact while iterating on domain-specific datasets.
