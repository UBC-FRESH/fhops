- **DOI:** 10.1016/j.softx.2020.100430
- **PII:** S2352711019302973
- **Domain:** Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment for massively parallel simulations.
- **Relevance to FHOPS:** Illustrates how to describe a large plugin ecosystem, community governance, and reproducibility guarantees—useful for FHOPS’ modular solver story.
- **Notable readiness signals:**
  - Architecture overview + plugin taxonomy, showing separation between core and application modules.
  - Reproducibility checklist (compilers, MPI stacks, OS support) embedded in manuscript.
  - Evidence of CI infrastructure and integration tests for downstream apps.
- **PDF status:** Pending manual download.
