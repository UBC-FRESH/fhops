Contributing
============

We welcome contributions! Before starting, review the planning artefacts in the repository root:

- ``ROADMAP.md`` for phase-level priorities and status.
- ``notes/`` directory for module-specific execution plans.
- ``AGENTS.md`` for required command cadence and documentation expectations.

Key practices:

- Create feature branches and keep changes scoped to roadmap tasks.
- Run the full command suite (format, lint, type-check, tests, pre-commit, Sphinx) prior to
  submitting pull requests.
- Update the relevant note and changelog entry with progress details.
- Coordinate larger design discussions via issues or draft PRs, then reflect resolutions in the
  planning documents.
