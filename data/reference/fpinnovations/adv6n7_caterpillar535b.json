    "Average bunch prepared by the feller-buncher contained 4.7 stems; skidder payloads of two or more bunches were rare because bunch size already matched grapple capacity.",
    "Skidding/l deck coordination (hot processing, loader-supported decking, or alternating short/long pulls) minimized deck congestion and kept skidder utilization near 93%.",
    "Recommended planning limits: keep grapple skidder distances below ~250–300 m, avoid uphill skidding on gentle slopes when downhill corridors exist, and reserve moist/fine-textured pockets for loader-forwarding or dry-season skidding."
