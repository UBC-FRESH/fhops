# Metaheuristic Roadmap

Date: 2025-??-??
Status: Draft — baseline SA exists; expansion pending Phase 2.

## Objectives
- Document current simulated annealing defaults (neighbourhood operators, cooling schedule) and establish reproducible benchmarks across scenario sizes.
- Upgrade simulated annealing implementation and evaluate alternative heuristics (Tabu, ILS, ALNS).
- Provide configuration presets accessible via CLI and documented in Sphinx.

## Planned Tasks
- [x] Document current SA parameter defaults and tuning rationale. *(Probability: initial temperature `max(1.0, best_score/10)`, decay `0.995`, restarts every 100 steps, neighbourhoods: day swap + intra-machine move; exposed via `--iters`, `--seed` in CLI.)*
- [x] Capture SA metrics via benchmarking harness (objective gap vs MIP, runtime, acceptance ratio).
- [ ] Implement operator registry to plug in new neighbourhood moves.
- [ ] Prototype Tabu Search with aspiration criteria and compare against SA baselines.
- [ ] Investigate hybrid approaches (MIP warm start + heuristic refinement).

## Testing & Evaluation
- [x] Create benchmark suite capturing objective value vs runtime for standard scenarios (minitoy/med42/large84 via `fhops bench suite`).
- [ ] Add stochastic regression tests with fixed seeds.
- [ ] Consider property-based tests for invariants (e.g., feasibility of generated schedules).

## Documentation
- [ ] Write Sphinx how-to for heuristic configuration.
- [ ] Surface benchmarking results in docs (tables/plots).

## Open Questions
- Do we need GPU-friendly implementations for large instances?
- How to expose experimental operators without destabilising default behaviour?
