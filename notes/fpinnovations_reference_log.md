## Next Actions
- Prioritize the Cable Yarding (FNCY) and Advantage issues targeting grapple yarders/swing yarders (e.g., ADV1N5, ADV5N28, ADV7N3) for productivity extraction.
- As each PDF is reviewed, update the table with a short abstract and note any usable regression equations or cost tables.
- Cross-reference promising reports back into `notes/dataset_inspection_plan.md` under the machine-role roadmap and the productivity registry backlog.
