        OpCost is an open-source forest operations cost simulator written in the R statistical

programming language. OpCost is an updated version of an earlier model, the Fuel Reduction

Cost Simulator (FRCS), with increased functionality. OpCost also has faster processing

speed when used within the landscape-scale analytical framework, Bioregional Inventory

Originated Under Management (BioSum). In this thesis, after providing a brief background

on cost modeling in operational forestry, I describe the development and structure of OpCost

in Chapter 2, which is subsequently being published as a General Technical Report by the

USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station. In Chapter 3, I describe a study

conducted to validate OpCost predictions using an independent data set, something which has

not been common in the fields of forest operations or forest engineering. In order to validate

model predictions, I used a mixed method survey approach to sample professional logging

contractor estimates of logging costs at each of three regional logging conferences in Idaho,

Washington and Oregon in 2016. Stand and site conditions for timber sales with a range of

pre-treatment conditions were generated using the Forest Vegetation Simulator model

coupled with GIS. This approach made it possible to obtain both OpCost-generated

predictions of fuel reduction treatment costs, and contractor estimated costs for areas with

identical conditions. OpCost predictions for total, system-wide treatment cost, were not

different from contractor estimates when compared using equivalence testing. However, the

production rates of individual pieces of equipment estimated by contractors differed from

those predicted by OpCost. Our approach to model validation using contractor surveys was

novel and useful because it facilitated standardized conditions provided as input to both the

contractors and the model. Fuel treatment cost estimation is critical for determining the cost

effectiveness of management decisions at the wildland urban interface (WUI) and beyond.

This work will help to advance landscape-scale analysis of the cost-effectiveness of fuel

treatments, guiding researchers and managers in better understanding the long-term

implications of their management decisions.

                         Operational Planning and Cost Estimation


Having accurate cost estimates of forest operations is essential for evaluating the economic

feasibility of forest management alternatives. The need for accurate cost estimates becomes

even greater when planning forest restoration activities as the cost of the operations

frequently exceeds the revenue from recovered material. The Fuels Reduction Cost Simulator

(FRCS, Hartsough, Fight, & Noordijk, 2006) sought to address this need with a macro-

driven, multi-sheet Excel spreadsheet tool into which users could enter parameters involving

a stand and the material to be harvested as part of fuel treatment operations. In FRCS, and in

OpCost, a user chooses a harvest system appropriate for a given site and stand conditions,

specifies the “cut list” that results from applying a silvicultural prescription designed to

reduce fuel loadings, and obtains estimated costs associated with implementation of that

prescription. As interest grew in obtaining such estimates for large numbers of stands treated

via a range of alternative prescriptions simulated on the landscape simultaneously, as

implemented in the BioSum model (Fried et al 2016), the inherent limitations of the

spreadsheet-based paradigm for simulating operational costs became evident. Forest

engineers at the University of Idaho, with support from the Joint Fire Sciences Program,

undertook a complete revamp of current harvesting cost models. The products of their efforts

include the OpCost forest operations cost model, programmed in R, and a validation study

that compared OpCost estimates with expert judgment collected via a formally designed

survey of logging professionals (Bell et al. 2016). In addition to updating currently available

production functions and cost estimates based on recent literature, OpCost includes some
                                                                                                2

additional harvest system capabilities, such as simulation of shovel logging, and has

improved methods for interfacing with BioSum.


OpCost incorporates production rates from over 85 studies, many with a vintage more recent

than the last version of FRCS, released in 2009, of both manual and mechanized operational

systems. One edition, OpCost BioSum Edition (BE), is distributed with the BioSum software

and implemented as a callable code package running under the R interpreter. OpCost BE is

tightly integrated with BioSum to estimate the costs for modeled forest harvest operations

simulated under that analysis framework. The other edition, OpCost Stand-alone Edition

(SE), can be run directly from the R development environment (R Development Core Team,

2016). OpCost is driven by the same variables used as inputs to its predecessor, FRCS. For

trees simulated as harvested, 24 variables account for average volume per tree, number of

trees harvested per acre, hardwood fraction, residue fraction and wood density for each of

three user-defined tree size classes, along with trees per acre and average tree volume of

small (“brush cut” size, in FRCS parlance) trees that are cut but not utilized. Other inputs

include slope and average distance to the nearest landing.

OpCost greatly streamlines workflow of a batch operation relative to FRCS by eliminating

the need to export data to Microsoft Excel as an intermediate step prior to cost estimation.

OpCost is also designed to operate in batch mode, but reads inputs from and writes outputs to

MS Access database tables, making it equally easy for users to estimate costs for one stand

and treatment or thousands of stands and dozens of treatment alternatives. The integration of

OpCost with BioSum produces cost estimates for each analyst-specified combination of

silvicultural prescription and harvest system on each inventory plot modeled in BioSum. This
                                                                                                3

facilitates estimates of cost-effectiveness for a wide range of fuel treatments on managed

forests in the West. The system can also be used to estimate harvest costs for implementing

any silvicultural prescription, not just those intended for hazardous fuel reductions.

Models have long been used in research and land management planning to understand and

predict processes and systems of interest (McHugh, 2006; Mitro, 2001; Vanclay &

Skovsgaard, 1997). The importance of using models has been just as crucial in understanding

the financial aspects of timber harvest operations and hazardous fuel reduction (Biesecker &

Fight, 2006; M. C. Bolding, Lanford, & Kellogg, 2003; D. Matthews, 1942). Reliable

estimates of the costs of implementing harvests, or any kind of mechanical manipulation of

forest vegetation, is important when prescribing, evaluating or comparing such forest

operations (D. M. Matthews, 1942; Pearce & Turner, 1990; Røpke, 2004), for example

determining the extent to which anticipated sales of harvested material are likely to offset

operations costs, and to predict how much area can be treated for a given budget or level of

subsidy. Whether forest treatments are motivated by forest products, forest health, fuels

reduction, or any other goal, the cost of operations can be difficult to predict with confidence

(M. C. Bolding et al., 2003; Jain et al., 2012; Pearce & Turner, 1990). Reliable estimates of

treatment cost provides land managers with information they need to understand the

economic implications of alternative silvicultural prescriptions and implementation schedules

(Agee & Skinner, 2005).

A new forest operations cost model was developed that builds on the Fuels Reduction Cost

Simulator (D. Dykstra, Hartsough, & Stokes, 2009; B. Hartsough, Fight, & Noordijk, 2006)

and expands its functionality by adding new harvest systems and other enhancements,

including newly published (since 2009) equipment production rate equations. As in other
                                                                                                4

areas of forestry, such as forest growth and yield modeling, model validation is an important

process for informing model users about the performance and limitations of simulation

models (Rykiel, 1996; Weiskittel, Hann, Jr, & Vanclay, 2011). Useful discussion of the

advantages and disadvantages of alternative approaches to evaluating models is provided in

Cawrse et al. (2010), Robinson & Froese (2004), Rykiel (1996), and Vanclay & Skovsgaard

(1997). The purpose of this validation is to evaluate the correspondence between the cost

estimates generated by OpCost and estimates obtained from logging professionals for

hypothetical operations. Conducting a formal evaluation is somewhat novel given that model

validation has not been deployed widely in forest operations (Kline, 2011; Vanclay &

Skovsgaard, 1997).

Like its predecessor, FRCS, OpCost is based on conventional, empirical cost control

methods as described in Matthews (1942), but has been updated with recent peer reviewed

production functions for many common harvesting systems. OpCost estimates costs

associated with 11 harvesting systems as a function of stand characteristics, using descriptors

of harvested trees derived from the CUTLIST table output of the Forest Vegetation Simulator

(FVS) model (Dixon, 2002; Stage, 1973) as input. OpCost can also evaluate multiple

management scenarios to estimate and facilitate comparison of economic implications of

alternative treatments, including the present value of treatments conducted in the future.

OpCost was developed to provide a user friendly, open-source, and transparent forest

operations cost model to support both research and management (Bell et al. 2016). This paper

describes a formal validation of OpCost with respect to both harvest systems (in terms of

operations cost) and the individual equipment types that collectively comprise each harvest

system.

Abstract


This report describes and documents the OpCost forest operations cost model, a key

component of the BioSum analysis framework. OpCost is available in two editions: as a

callable executable for use with BioSum, and in a stand-alone edition that can be run directly

from R. OpCost model logic and assumptions for this open-source tool are explained,

references to the literature used for all of the sub=models included in OpCost are provided,

and guidance is offered on how to change the default hourly machine rates associated with

overall logging cost calculations. OpCost enhancements such as cost component breakout,

and identifying the least cost harvest system, are also described and explained.


Introduction


Estimating costs of forest operations is essential for evaluating the economic feasibility of

forest management alternatives, especially those involving partial harvest conducted as a

component of forest restoration, where costs may be a large fraction of, or exceed, revenues

from sales of harvested wood. The Fuels Reduction Cost Simulator (FRCS) (Fight et al.

2006), the development of which began over two decades ago, sought to address this need

with a multi-sheet Excel®1 spreadsheet tool into which users could enter parameters

associated with stand conditions and the material to be harvested as part of fuel treatment

operations. In FRCS, and in OpCost, the user chooses a harvest system appropriate for a
                                                                                               6

given site and stand conditions, specifies the “cut list” that results from applying a

silvicultural prescription designed to reduce fuel loadings, and obtains estimated costs

associated with implementation of that prescription. As interest grew in obtaining treatment

cost estimates for large numbers of stands treated via a range of alternative prescriptions

simulated on the landscape simultaneously, as implemented in the BioSum model (Fried et

al. 2016) and other approaches to modeling landscape-scale operational logistics (Jacobson et

al. 2016), the inherent limitations of the spreadsheet-based paradigm for simulating

operational costs became evident. Operations foresters at the University of Idaho, with

support from the Joint Fire Sciences Program, undertook a revision and restructuring of the

FRCS model. The products of their efforts include the OpCost forest operations cost model,

programmed in R, and a validation study that compared OpCost estimates with expert

judgments collected via a formally designed survey of logging professionals (Bell et al.

2017). In addition to updating currently available production functions and cost estimates

based on recent literature, OpCost includes some additional harvest system capabilities, such

as simulation of shovel logging, and provides a more reliable interface to BioSum.


OpCost incorporates production rates from over 85 studies, many with a vintage more recent

than the last version of FRCS, released in 2009, of both manual and mechanized operational

systems. One edition of the model, OpCost BioSum Edition (BE), is distributed with the

BioSum software. OpCost BE is a callable code package, running under R (R Development

Core Team 2016), that tightly integrates with BioSum to estimate the costs for modeled forest

harvest operations simulated under that analysis framework. The other edition, OpCost

Stand-alone Edition (SE), can be run directly from the R development environment. OpCost is

driven by essentially the same variables used as inputs to its predecessor, FRCS. For trees
                                                                                                7

simulated as harvested, 35 variables account for average volume per tree, number of trees

harvested per acre, hardwood fraction, merchantable volume as a percentage of total volume

and wood density for each of three user-defined tree size classes, along with trees per acre

and average tree volume of small (“brush cut” size, in FRCS parlance) trees that are cut but

not utilized. Other inputs include slope and average distance to the nearest landing and, for

small and large log trees, the percentage of wood volume transported to the landing that will

be chipped owing to its derivation from trees of submerchantable size or noncommercial

species. Average travel time, in hours, required to move-in a harvest system equipment

component (e.g., a skidder) to the harvest site and operation size, in acres, are required to

estimate move-in costs on a per acre basis.


OpCost greatly streamlines workflow of a batch operation relative to FRCS by eliminating

the need to export data to Microsoft Excel as an intermediate step prior to cost estimation.

OpCost is also designed to operate in batch mode, but reads inputs from and writes outputs to

MS Access database tables, making it equally easy for users to estimate costs for one stand

and treatment or thousands of stands and dozens of treatment alternatives. The integration of

OpCost with BioSum produces cost estimates for each analyst specified combination of

silvicultural prescription and harvest system on each inventory plot modeled in BioSum. This

facilitates estimates of cost-effectiveness for the wide range of fuel treatments on managed

forests in the Western United States (see, e.g., Jain et al. 2012). The system can also estimate

harvest costs for implementing any silvicultural prescription, not just those intended to

reduce hazardous fuels.
                                                                                                  8

OpCost Framework: Overview


Production functions in OpCost use, as inputs, the estimated amount of removed or altered

material within forest stands based on summary metrics from simulated silvicultural

prescriptions that generate a “cut list” in the FVS (Forest Vegetation Simulator) (Dixon 2002)

format. These predict, on a per-acre basis, the time and expense required to harvest and

process wood volume. In essence, OpCost is an equation filtering and aggregation engine

that, considering the specifics of a stand, silvicultural treatment to be modeled, and harvest

system to be implemented, applies several possible equations extracted from peer-reviewed

forest operations literature. These are typically based on past elemental time analysis and

work sampling studies that are identified as applicable to the stand and site under

consideration; OpCost computes the average of the predictions of all applicable equations.

By using the regression equations from descriptive studies, OpCost can predict the

production rates of the equipment within certain conditions. Applicability is determined by

whether an equation is eliminated from consideration by “rejection” criteria that differ among

equations for a given harvesting, extraction, or processing machine. Examples of rejection

criteria, which are evaluated for each operation based on whether or not the OpCost inputs

fall within the acceptable range for an equation, include slope, average volume per tree,

average distance to landing, whether hardwoods are part of the harvest, average tree

diameter, average tree weight, and harvested trees per acre. Non-rejected equations for each

machine used in a harvest system advance to the next computation phase. The rejection

criteria are based on the range of data over which original studies were evaluated, in order to

avoid extrapolation of production or cost functions beyond the range of their source data and

intended application.
                                                                                               9

Estimating machine time required

A harvest system can be thought of as a collection of the equipment, or machines, and labor

required to implement operations under that system. For example, a Cable Manual Whole-

tree system typically operates on steep slopes and, after manual tree felling by a sawyer,

brings entire trees, including bole, branches and top (as opposed to previously-bucked logs)

to the landing using a yarder. At the landing, whole trees are processed into merchantable

logs and nonmerchantable residues with a processor, which may be either a stroke-boom

delimber or danglehead processor. Logs are then loaded onto log trucks with a loader and

residues are chipped and blown into a chip van. Thus, this system involves five machines:

manual felling (sawyer with a chainsaw), yarder, processor, loader, and chipper, each of

which may have up to a dozen or more published equations that could be used to predict the

time required per unit of trees or volume handled. Given the diversity of study purposes and

locales behind the published equations, and differences in the factors affecting costs for

different machines, tree units differ among machines and among studies. Wood

characteristics tracked by the model may be expressed on a volume or mass basis, depending

on the relevant production function and study. Volumes may be expressed in cubic feet,

board feet, cords or cubic meters, and mass values may be in pounds or kilograms. Times are

summed across size classes, and these sums are then combined into the mean time in hours

per acre.


Estimating machine cost

Once total machine working time has been adjusted into hours per acre, machine cost per

acre is computed as the product of hours and machine cost rates, which are based on
                                                                                               10

conventional cost control processes (Matthews 1942). Calculations occur in productive

machine hours (PMH) and following convention in forest operations studies, a utilization rate

is assigned to distinguish between production and delay time. Because OpCost generates

estimates at a stand level, without regard to stand location, it cannot assign location-specific

move-in costs associated with each machine’s use. However, when using OpCost within a

BioSum analysis, per acre move-in costs can be accounted for based on travel time to wood

processing facilities (a parameter calculated as part of the BioSum workflow and a viable

proxy for move-in time) and assumed stand area undergoing treatment. Move-in costs could

also be affected by the locations of scheduled work in a particular year; however, this level of

detail is beyond the scope of OpCost and BioSum and is not addressed. Wherever available,

machine rates include fixed and variable costs associated with owning and operating the

equipment. These have been updated with current estimates (Dodson et al. 2015). Default

machine cost rates, developed for the Pacific Northwest region, are supplied in the OpCost

code, but can be changed by the user, if desired and necessary, via a straightforward text edit

to the open source model code (for OpCost BE) or to the appropriate input table (for OpCost

SE).


Estimating harvest system cost

After machine cost estimates are complete, harvest cost per acre can be calculated as the sum

of each of the predicted machine-specific treatment costs associated with the harvest system

working in the BioSum-supplied site and stand conditions. For the cable manual whole-tree

system example, this would be the sum of treatment costs per acre for sawyer, yarder and

carriage combination, processor, loader, and chipper. Treatment cost accounts for both the

machine rates and the production rates for each piece of equipment. Production rates are
                                                                                              11

typically expressed in tons per PMH or MBF per PMH and provide predictions of the total

treatment time required by each piece of equipment to treat volume removed per acre. See,

e.g. Keefe et al. (2014) for further description of the relationship between machine rates,

production rates, and treatment costs. Move-in cost, derived from the number of machines

transported to the harvest site and assumptions that account for delays in setting up

equipment, when applicable, is added to obtain the final harvest cost reported in the table

OpCost_Output. That table also contains calculated move-in cost in a separate column to

better inform the analyst wishing to consider, for example, savings that might accrue from

consolidating forest operations.


Enhancements


A significant enhancement compared to FRCS is the simultaneous estimation of costs for

multiple, potentially more cost-efficient harvest systems. These estimates can be compared to

the costs of the analyst- specified harvest system, replacing them if desired. By default, cost

estimates for the lowest cost harvest system are output to a table called

“OpCost_Ideal_Output.” Users wishing to prevent the creation of this table, thus slightly

shortening execution time, can change the “1” to a “0” in the following OpCost statement:

idealTable1 (currently line 20 in version 8.7.9) of the executable code.


Another new feature is the reporting of chipping costs in a separate column in both the

OpCost_Output and OpCost_ Ideal_Output tables. This could be useful when considering

alternative approaches to disposal of harvest residues, as when a treatment leaves residues at

the landing for collection as firewood or later burning— chipping cost might then be

deducted from the harvest cost.
                                                                                                 12

How it works- in detail


This section describes OpCost processing in greater detail, including the specific inputs and

intermediate processing steps. This information is current as of version 8.7.9.


OpCost predicts operations costs for 11 harvest systems. Each system can be thought of as an

integrated sequence of activities utilizing several pieces of equipment, operating in a

coordinated fashion, to move wood from trees to trucks, while accomplishing management

objectives. For example, a harvest system may be used to transform a forest stand in terms of

its density, tree species and size distribution, surface vegetation and fuels, and emergent

properties such as forest health, resistance to fire, and overall resilience that derive from

these. In addition to differences in how harvested material is felled and transported, harvest

systems differ in the materials that are collected for utilization. OpCost provides for five

harvest system categories to reflect these differences when estimating operations costs (table

1). The 11 systems included in OpCost (table 2) cover nearly all forest management activities

that involve mechanical fuel treatment and other harvest. To estimate the cost of applying

these systems to implement particular prescriptions on specific stands, OpCost relies on 124

equations extracted from 82 published articles (table 3) covering all 11 machine types used in

these 11 harvest systems. For each equipment type, the available equations differ in the

inputs that are required, so the “independent variables” column in table 3 is an exhaustive list

of attributes used by any of the equations in the equipment category. The meaning of most of

these attributes is straightforward. Piece volume is average volume per tree; total volume is

volume per acre. Depending on the equation, species group is ultimately either a binary
                                                                                                 13

descriptor indicating whether hardwoods comprise more than 1 percent of the harvested

material or the percentage of volume that is in hardwoods.


Inputs

BioSum initiates an instance of R, passing to it the OpCost BE filename and the name of an

Access file that contains all input data in a table named opcost_input. This table consists of

35 attributes per stand (table 4). In general, but with a few exceptions for size classes, where

some are not needed, there is a quintet of harvested tree descriptors for each of four size

classes defined by the user in BioSum, plus a few site descriptors. Note that the size class

definitions themselves (in terms of minimum and maximum diameter at breast height

[d.b.h.]) are not passed to, or needed by, OpCost. The four size classes are brush cut (BC),

chip trees (CT), small log trees (SLT) and large log trees (LLT). Each of these size classes is

determined by the analyst. The BC trees are harvested but not utilized, so OpCost accounts

only for the costs of their felling. The CT boles are assumed to be utilized as “dirty” chips

(with bark not removed before chipping) and have no merchantable value that would exceed

their value as dirty chips; limbs are also utilized as chips when whole-tree harvest systems

are used. Chip trees are the noncommercial trees and are accounted as a percentage of total

volume for each size class. Note that average tree volumes provided as inputs to OpCost are

total volumes, including tops and limbs.



Transformations

A comparison of the variables listed in table 3 (required input variables) and table 4 (OpCost

inputs) shows that while most are aligned, there are some required variables not provided by
                                                                                                 14

BioSum. As each stand is processed, OpCost effects transformations to ensure that the input

requirements for all 124 equations can be met. For example, OpCost estimates average d.b.h.,

which is required by at least some production functions for most equipment types, by

inverting formulas associated with common log scale rules such as the International ¼-inch

rule (Grosenbaugh 1952) and Scribner’s Decimal C (Bruce and Schumacher 1950), to predict

d.b.h. from BioSum-supplied average volume per tree. In several cases, it is necessary to

estimate average interterm distance (which is required by at least some of the sawyer, CTL

harvester, and feller-buncher equations) from TPA supplied by BioSum. Mean inter-tree

distance is estimated from TPA as follows: Intertree distance = �(43560 ⁄ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇)


Because some equations estimate time required per unit mass, OpCost calculates mass per

acre, by tree size class and in total, by multiplying BioSum-supplied average wood density by

average tree volume and TPA. Depending on the referenced equations used, some volumes

are converted to cubic feet, board feet, or cords per acre. All volumes and masses are also

converted to metric units (cubic meters per hectare or kilograms per hectare) to fulfill the

requirements of equations defined in metric units.


Filtering

When processing each stand, OpCost applies the rejection criteria associated with each of the

124 equipment equations to eliminate equations deemed unsuitable for estimating costs for

that stand. Typically, these rejection criteria are derived from the range of an attribute

reflected in the empirical data on which an equation was fit. Any of the attributes may be the

basis for rejection criteria. For CTL harvesters and feller-bunchers, D.B.H. is an important

filter; for yarders, distance to landing and slope might be attributes with rejection criteria, but
                                                                                                 15

the criteria will differ among equipment types and among equations for a given equipment

type, thus the sets of equations used for any two stands that are in some respects similar, may

still differ.


Size Class Specific versus Total/Average

Equations differ as to whether or not they take stand-level- or size-class-specific inputs, even

for a given equipment type. For those that operate with individual size classes (e.g., CT, SLT,

and LLT), harvested tree descriptors such as average volume and TPA are processed for a

specific size class to obtain equipment time associated with that size class. Ultimately, the

equipment times for all size classes are summed. With mixed systems, for example when

only large log trees are manually felled, sawyer equations would use only the LLT

descriptors. Because the requirements differ among equations, OpCost calculates overall

stand averages and totals for all harvested trees, as noted under “Transformations” above, so

that these are available for the equations that rely on them.


OpCost Workflow

For a given equipment type, OpCost calls a machine-specific function. For a yarder time

estimate, for example, it would call the yarder function, passing two arguments: the input

variables generated by BioSum via the opcost_input table and the list of candidate production

functions for that equipment. Parsing each opcost_input record, that function would reject

inappropriate yarder equations, create the necessary transformed attributes, estimate yarder

times per unit of material for all the appropriate equations, and adjust time per tree unit to

time per acre for each tree size class separately, if necessary. It would then sum across size

classes, compute the average over estimates from all yarder equations, multiply the estimated
                                                                                                  16

time per acre by yarder unit cost in dollars per hour and return that cost component to be used

when adding up the cost of all machines used on that stand, at that time, with that harvest

system.


When using OpCost SE, harvest year can be included as an input and optionally, if a discount

(interest) rate is provided, harvest cost estimates can be expressed in present or future value

terms. When using OpCost BE with BioSum, discounting and inflation considerations are

handled within the BioSum modeling framework.




Putting It All together

Figure 1 summarizes the seven major processing steps that occur within OpCost to compute

the multiple components of harvest cost and combine them into an estimate of complete

harvest cost per acre. Model output is deterministic in that a given set of stand inputs will

always produce the same results as long as the same FVS stand projection (output) data are

included. Note that, apart from BioSum, users sometimes choose to run FVS in a stochastic

mode. Thus, OpCost users that repeat growth and yield predictions for the same stand

multiple times in FVS prior to post processing with OpCost should expect that projected

stand conditions may differ owing to inclusion of random numbers in underlying FVS code.

This, in turn, may result in variability among associated OpCost treatment cost estimates.


OpCost Stand-alone Edition (SE)


OpCost SE is designed to operate without BioSum, and relies on an installed version of R 3.0

or greater (R Development Core Team 2016), with the RODBC (Ripley and Lapsley 2016),
                                                                                                  17

Shiny (Chang et al. 2016), and ggplot2 (Wickham 2009) packages installed and loaded.

There are three required script files that are available for download, and all three files should

be saved to a single reference folder in the analyst’s computer. The files are called ui.r,

server.r, and OpCostShiny.r. These files are available at the following URL:

http://www.uidahoforestoperations.com/forest-operations-modeling.html. Each R script

needs to be stored in the same directory on the user’s computer so the server code can locate

the other files. After the files have been loaded, they are then available to open in the R

environment using either the R console or a development environment such as RStudio. The

user then runs the Shiny-based OpCost Graphical User Interface in R and the app will appear

in the computer’s default web browser (tested with Internet Explorer) allowing for a simple,

interactive and intuitive user interface. The inputs are the same as for OpCost BE and can be

stored in either comma or space delimited text files.


Once the application is open in the browser window, the user begins by navigating to and

selecting the input file. A progress bar provides feedback as this data is loaded and processed,

typically within seconds. When the progress bar achieves 100 percent, the estimated costs per

acre using the harvest system chosen by the user will appear in a table, with one row per

stand ID and prescription year. Each table generated by OpCost may be selected and copied

or downloaded as a text file using the table buttons. After the table appears, the user also has

the option of selecting the “ideal” table, present cost of future treatments, and ideal present

costs of future treatments. The present cost and ideal present cost tables contain the

discounted costs of harvest prescribed for a future year. The analyst also has the ability to

select a different state, with different assumed machine rates, or can designate custom
                                                                                               18

machine rates using the third tab of the interface by selecting the designated check box,

which activates the custom machine rate table.


Each loaded table actively updates as an analyst adjusts prescription year or machine rates,

streamlining the process for experimenting with different scenarios. After creating these

tables, the analyst can proceed to the figures page where each of the tables previously created

can be displayed graphically. The figures page also provides a graphical cost comparison of

the analyst-defined harvest system and the system estimated by OpCost as the lowest cost

alternative. Note that figures will only be viewable after tables have been created. Figures can

be copied and pasted to a separate document, or saved to disk, using the menu options that

appear when right-clicking on the image.


To run another set of stand operations without starting a new session, save the output data, if

desired, before loading a new dataset. OpCost SE does not automatically save outputs to files

or maintain previous estimates in memory so any information from the previous analysis will

be overwritten when new data are loaded. All output tables and figures will also be lost if

exiting the program without first saving these to disk.


Future Directions


OpCost’s adaptable design enables it to handle a wide variety of systems and to accommodate

new systems yet to be developed. Development is underway to enable production rates for new

kinds of equipment to be implemented by entering the parameter and predictor variables

associated with production and machine rates for new equipment and systems into a

preformatted Excel table. The production function supplied should include output in total
                                                                                               19

treatment time (delay-free Productive Machine Hours), expressed on a per-acre basis. Users

should also supply the key components of equipment machine rates: purchase price,

utilization rate, etc. See, e.g., Brinker et al. 2002 for a description of machine rate

calculations. The user-supplied production function parameters and machine rates will be

incorporated into system-level logging cost predictions as described in, e.g., Keefe et al.

(2014). A sample Excel table and details on how this table will be accessed by OpCost will

be documented in the release notes accompanying a future OpCost version.


One of the great benefits of providing OpCost in the open-source R framework is that it

facilitates coordinated growth, development, and testing by a more expansive set of users

than did earlier Excel and VBA-based versions of FRCS and related models. We anticipate

making OpCost available as part of a package of R functions in the future in order to foster

widespread distribution and use, especially for automated landscape-scale analyses. In its

current incarnation, OpCost relies on stand-level FVS summaries of harvested trees. We

envision refinements to the model that would base cost estimates on the full FVS tree list

data, instead of summary metrics, potentially leading to greater accuracy and higher

resolution simulation of operational logistics.

          Validation of the OpCost logging cost model using contractor surveys


Introduction


Models have long been used in research and land management planning to understand and

predict processes and systems of interest (Stage 1973; Vanclay & Skovsgaard 1997; Mitro

2001; McHugh 2006; Ackerman et al. 2014). The importance of using models has been just

as crucial in understanding the financial aspects of timber harvest operations and hazardous

fuel reduction (Matthews 1942; Bolding et al. 2003; Biesecker & Fight 2006). Reliable

estimation of the costs of implementing harvests, or any kind of mechanical manipulation of

forest vegetation, is important when prescribing, evaluating or comparing such forest

operations (Matthews 1942; Pearce & Turner 1990; Røpke 2004). For example, accurate

estimation of costs is needed to determine the extent to which anticipated sales of harvested

material are likely to offset treatment expense, and to predict how much area can be treated

for a given budget or level of subsidy. Whether forest treatments are motivated by forest

products, forest health, fuels reduction, or any other goal, the cost of operations can be

difficult to predict with confidence (Pearce & Turner 1990; Bolding et al. 2003; Jain et al.

2012). Reliable estimates of treatment costs provide land managers with information they

need to understand the economic implications of alternative silvicultural prescriptions and

implementation schedules to reduce fuels (Agee & Skinner 2005).
                                                                                              41

OpCost is a new forest operations cost model that builds on the Fuels Reduction Cost Simulator

(Hartsough et al. 2006; Dykstra et al. 2009) and expands its functionality by adding new harvest

systems and other enhancements, including newly published (since 2009) equipment

production rate equations. Increasingly, OpCost is being used to simulate landscape level

analysis to meet hazardous fuel reduction objectives and evaluate woody biomass utilization

planning scenarios (Bell & Keefe 2014). In other subject areas of forestry, such as forest growth

and yield modeling, model validation is considered an impor-tant process for informing model

users about the performance and limitations of simulation models (Rykiel 1996; Weiskittel et

al. 2011). Useful discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of alternative approaches to

evaluating models is provided in Cawrse et al. (2010), Robinson and Froese (2004), Rykiel

(1996), and Vanclay and Skovsgaard (1997). Despite the wide-spread use of predictive

modeling in forest engineering and forest operations, and particularly the application of

productive cycle time regression models developed using elemental time analysis (see e.g.

Olsen & Kellogg 1983 for commonly used methods), there has been comparatively little use

of formal model validation techniques to evaluate the quality of predictions that result from

use of these models in practice (see e.g. Vanclay & Skovsgaard 1997; Kline 2011). The purpose

of this paper is to more formally validate and evaluate the correspondence between predicted

cost estimates generated through simulation using the OpCost logging cost model, which

integrates several dozen such published equations, and estimates obtained from professional

logging contractors for fuel reduction treatments with identical conditions. Conducting a

formal evaluation of this sort for fuel treatments across a range of stand and site conditions

regionally is both novel and of high importance, given that OpCost is now included in regional

modeling efforts that are at times used to inform management and policy related to forest
                                                                                              42

health, including recent deployment of OpCost as a component of the Bioregional Inventory

Originated Simulation Under Management framework, or BioSum (Daugherty & Fried 2007;

Barbour et al. 2008; Fried et al. 2016, 2017).



Like its predecessor, FRCS, OpCost is based on conventional, empirical cost estimation

methods (Matthews 1942; Miyata 1980), but has been updated with recent, peer-reviewed

production functions for many common harvesting systems. OpCost estimates costs associated

with 11 harvesting systems as a function of stand characteristics, using descriptors of harvested

trees derived from the out-put tables of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) model (Stage

1973; Dixon 2002) within the broader framework of landscape-level analysis of forest

management and logistics in BioSum. U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data are

provided to FVS as input data. Stand growth based on those inventory data conditions are then

projected over time using FVS. The resulting stand characteristics are interpreted within the

BioSum framework (Fried et al. 2017). BioSum intermittently restructures and passes stand

and site conditions to OpCost. OpCost then simulates harvesting for each stand prescription

provided, and returns estimated treatment costs, often for several thou-sand stands on the

landscape simultaneously (Fried et al. 2016, 2017). The resulting output is summarized by

BioSum in the context of broader landscape forest management planning and logistics in ways

that synthesize both forest health and renewable energy goals over large areas (Figure 1).

The BioSum framework thus enables landscape-scale analyses of silvicultural management

alternatives and their eco-logical and economic outcomes in both time and space. At various

stages, OpCost transforms stand prescription

information into forms suitable as input to the many production and cost formulas referenced

in Table 1 to simulate the costs of silvicultural activities. OpCost is designed to be used

alternatively for individual stand treatment cost estimation by a model user, or to be run

simultaneously for many stands within BioSum. With this latter approach, it is particularly

important to represent the variability in costs for fuel treatments and associated woody biomass

removals (e.g. chipping of small diameter stems removed in thinning operations). These vary

widely on the landscape as a function of many factors, including stand productivity, species-

specific defect, piece size, trees per acre being removed, and associated yarding distance (e.g.

Keefe et al. 2014; Saralecos et al. 2015; Fried et al. 2016, 2017; Jacobson et al. 2016). These

factors are known to affect how logging costs vary among regions, even within the Pacific

Northwest USA (Dodson et al. 2015).
                                                                                                44

OpCost can operate in standalone mode to evaluate multiple management scenarios to estimate

and facilitate comparison of economic implications of alternative treatments, including the

present value of fuel reduction treatments conducted in the future. The model was developed

to provide an open-source and transparent cost model to support both research and management

with emphasis on forest health and bioenergy (Bell & Keefe 2014). This paper describes a

formal validation of OpCost-simulated treatment costs expressed on a per unit area basis, and

of the individual, equipment-specific production rates that influence those broader, system-

level costs across a range of fuel treatments. Because many contractors are reluctant to share

detailed logging cost information and it is difficult to otherwise obtain consistent cost data over

the wide range of stand density, slope, yarding distance, and other conditions that are provided

to OpCost as input data when modeling forest health treatments, we instead developed a new,

survey-based methodology that leveraged the expertise of professional logging contractors to

evaluate the accuracy of OpCost predictions.

Materials and methods


After receiving permission from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Idaho for

survey sampling involving human subjects (University of Idaho IRB protocol #16–1212), a

validation survey was deployed using a mixed method sampling approach that incorporated

both mail surveys and face-to-face contact at three regional logging conferences to sample

logging contractors with expert knowledge of production rates and operational costs. Only

contractors with at least 3 years of work experience were included in the study. According to

the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are approximately 740 logging workers in Idaho, 2230 in

Washington and 3850 in Oregon as of 2013 (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2015). Of that number,

we assumed that the number of individuals familiar with production rates and costs for all

equipment in a given system, typically company owners or experienced supervisors at larger

companies, was in the range of 1000–2000 individuals.


For the face-to-face component of the study, surveys were administered using a modified

convenience sampling approach at three logging conferences in 2016: the Oregon Logging

Conference in Eugene, OR; the Intermountain Logging Conference in Spokane, WA; and the

Olympic Logging Conference in Victoria, BC. Convenience sampling is an effective method

for surveying target populations of interest (Chein 1981; Singleton et al. 1993). Randomization

can be introduced into sampling strategies for convenient populations by, for example,

surveying at randomized times during events in order to reduce hidden biases (Tittle 1980;

Dillman 2000). We modified this approach, as follows. After generating interest among

potential respondents at each conference to consider completing a survey using the enticement

of a chance to win a scale model of common logging equipment, we screened these individuals
                                                                                            48

for experience with estimating logging costs, and drew our interview sample from the resulting

group of interested and qualified participants.


Mail surveys were also sent to 248 contractors chosen randomly from lists of individuals

registered with each state’s professional logging association. Contractors were again screened

using the same criteria. Using both methods (mail survey and face-to-face), a total of 132

completed surveys were received. Of these, 55 were excluded from the analysis reported in

this paper because of missing information, unclear reporting of units or because the sample

size was insufficient to evaluate logging systems that were not well represented in the surveys

returned. For example, because a single survey was provided to each participant, several con-

tractors who specialized primarily in one logging system (e.g. cable logging) received a survey

designed for a different system (e.g. ground-based, cut-to-length) and only partially completed

it. There was no defensible method for imputing missing values in logging system production

rates or component cost estimates without confusing or adding bias to our model validation

analysis. Consequently, if any component process (e.g. felling, skidding, processing or

loading) was left blank or was unusable for other reasons, the entire survey was excluded from

analysis. In this paper, data from 77 total completed surveys with high quality, complete

estimates of individual equipment production rates and overall, system-level cost estimates for

the four primary logging systems across the three state region were used in our analysis. This

corresponds to approximately 20 surveys each for the four systems of interest. Assuming a

population of contractors with logging cost expertise of approximately 1500 individuals

regionally, the final sample size used in our study represents approximately 5.1% of the target

population.
                                                                                               49

We relied on several techniques to reduce non-response, and the potential bias to which it could

lead. These included personalized messages in the mail survey, use of the face-to-face survey

approach at the three conference venues, and offering participants tokens of appreciation,

which are known to reduce satisfice and non-response (Goyder 1985; Holbrook et al. 2003).

The use of token prizes can also enhance the quality of data collected (Singleton et al. 1993;

Holbrook et al. 2003; Aquilino 2009).


Surveys used in the study included 24 mock timber sale prospectuses representing a range of

stand and site conditions for four different primary harvest systems deployed in forest

management focused primarily on thinning or reduction of hazardous fuels in each of the three

states. A total of 288 unique possible vignettes to be evaluated were developed and distributed

as part of the analysis reported here. Use of this artificial timber sale prospectus method as the

basis for estimating treatment costs was inspired by the success of this approach in construction

surveys (Morrison 1984), as well as prior experience of a coauthor surveying wildland

firefighters to estimate fireline production rates for quantitative modeling (Fried & Gilless

1989; Gilless & Fried 2000). The prospectus associated with each survey was tailored to

conditions typical in the region where that contractor worked so that estimated production rates

and costs could be used to distinguish fine resolution in model predictions across the ranges of

several key input variables that vary considerably from coastal Oregon and Washington to dry

sites in the Inland Northwest. Variability in local conditions, such as stem size (DBH), stand

density, yarding distance, total stand volume, and biomass residue (logging slash) per acre are

important factors affecting fuel reduction treatment costs and woody biomass logistics (Keefe

et al. 2014; Jacobson et al. 2016). These predictors are important drivers of equipment-specific

productive cycle times, and hence the treatment costs, for many of the time-and-motion studies
                                                                                                50

referenced in Table 1. These equations work together in OpCost to simulate forest operations

in landscape-level analyses.


For each mock timber sale prospectus, survey participants were asked to estimate the total

treatment cost per acre, as well as the component production rates for each piece of equipment

used in a given logging system, excluding move-in, move-out, and road development costs.

Each participant developed estimates for a single prospectus corresponding to a single mock

timber sale. Not all treatments were necessarily merchantable, as many included relatively

small merchantable removal volumes typical of thinning operations. The majority of removals

were less than 10 MBF ac−1. Each mock prospectus included type of harvest system, yarding

distance (ft), slope (%), harvested trees per acre by size class, net volume per acre (thousand

board feet), gross volume per acre (thou-sand board feet), species composition as a percentage

of stand basal area, the number of logs per acre, basal area per acre (sq. ft.), a hillshade map of

the harvest unit, and total area of the harvest unit (acres). The format and range of stand

conditions used to create mock prospectuses for the surveys were patterned from 38 operational

timber sale prospectus documents obtained from the Idaho Department of Lands, Oregon

Department of Forestry, and Washington Department of Natural Resources forestry divisions,

and USDA Forest Service Regions 1 and 6. These operational prospectuses pro-vided a basis

for defining the ranges of variables considered as typical fuel treatments for the region and

were generally partial harvests. Stand conditions for the mock prospectuses used in our surveys

were generated using FVS, which ensured that OpCost predictions were based on conditions

identical to those evaluated by logging contractors completing the surveys.
                                                                                              51

We assembled the survey-based stand treatment cost estimates and OpCost-simulated

treatment costs for the identical stand conditions into a paired data set, and plotted all paired

values. Quantile-quantile plots were used to evaluate the normality assumptions of linear

regression (Singleton et al. 1993; Goodman 1996) and model residuals were plotted against

OpCost predicted values. We then used model equivalence testing using the two one-sided t-

test (TOST) to evaluate the similarity of OpCost predictions and survey-based estimates

(Robinson & Froese 2004) for the same stand and site conditions. Equivalence testing provides

a more conservative approach to validation of model predictions by shifting the burden of proof

in statistical hypothesis testing. Rather than the usual statistical test indicating a lack of

difference among two sample means, equivalence testing shifts the rejection region to provide

evidence of similarity between observed and modeled (predicted) values (Robinson & Froese

2004). Equivalence testing has been used previously to validate that predicted tree diameter

growth rates over time correspond well with actual measured growth rates observed in forest

inventory data (Robinson & Froese 2004) and to evaluate GNSS-based pre-dictions of loader

swing cycle elements (Becker et al. 2017). In this study, we adapted the approach to formally

test whether fuel treatment cost predictions from OpCost were statistically similar to those

obtained via expert assessments by logging contractors.


The collected surveys and OpCost estimates were analyzed using the equivalence package in

R, which provides analytical methods for evaluating similarity of two samples (Robinson &

Froese 2004; Robinson 2014). The null hypothesis tested was that the two populations of

interest, in this case OpCost model predictions and contractor-provided estimates for the same

stands and conditions, were dissimilar. We rejected dissimilarity with the alternative

hypothesis that the populations were adequately similar, defined as having standardized
                                                                                             52

differences between mean cost and production rate of no more than a specified magnitude. A

two one-sided t-test (TOST) was used with a power of alpha = 0.1 and a predetermined

acceptance threshold within 20% of the observed standard deviation. This type of statistical

test was chosen because it provides a more conservative test for model evaluation than the

more commonly used standard t-test, and the significance of the test is less affected by sample

size (Robinson & Froese 2004). For each survey response, the cost of the complete harvesting

system, represented as total treatment cost per unit area, was compared to the corresponding

cost estimate generated through simulation using OpCost for the same harvesting systems and

prospectus. This same analysis was then repeated again for the production rates of individual

pieces of equipment, in order to better understand components of error in overall system-wide

predictions of logging costs in fuel reduction operations.




Results


The null hypothesis of non-equivalence (dissimilarity) was rejected and the alternative was

accepted when comparing OpCost predicted treatment costs per hectare and survey-based

estimates for all four primary harvesting systems evaluated (cable manual whole-tree, ground-

based manual whole-tree, ground-based cut-to-length, and ground-based mechanical whole-

tree). Thus, for all four systems, OpCost predictions were statistically similar to survey-based

estimates of total treatment cost per hectare provided by professional logging contractors

across the range of stand and site characteristics considered in the three state region. Results

from the two one-sided t-test (TOST) validation are shown in Table 2. For each system shown,

the mean value reported is the mean difference between OpCost-predicted treatment cost per
                                                                                              53

hectare and the corresponding, survey-based estimates from contractors. Estimates for ground-

based mechanical whole-tree logging from OpCost had the greatest agreement with estimates

provided by contractors, while they were least similar for cable-based manual whole-tree

predictions.


Plots of OpCost-predicted treatment cost per acre and the corresponding survey-based

estimates for the same stand conditions for each logging system are shown in Figure 2. Costs

for ground-based manual whole-tree treatments tended to be over-predicted; predictions were

greater than the survey estimates, showing evidence of a small positive bias. The same was

true for cable manual whole-tree. However, correspondence improved at higher costs per

hectare. Predictions for ground-based mechanical whole-tree were the least variable, judging

by the extent to which observations depart from the 1:1 line and have the smallest standard

deviation of OpCost and survey-based differences in Table 2 (71.2 $US ac−1). Errors associated

with ground-based cut-to-length system predictions had high variability but did not show

obvious prediction bias when evaluated graphically. Overall model residuals for all OpCost

predictions and all survey estimates of treatment cost per unit area are shown in Figure 3.


Figures 2–5 show how OpCost-simulated production rates compare to logger estimated

production rates for individual pieces of equipment operating within each harvest system.

Using the same TOST validation method, the null hypothesis of dissimilarity was rejected for

the predicted production rates of 5 out of 15 combinations of equipment and system, indicating

accurate prediction of production rates for that subset. For the other 10 pieces of equipment,

the null hypothesis could not be rejected, indicating that the model did not perform well.

production rate was rejected for sawyers, processors, and loaders operating in a cable-based

manual whole-tree system, indicating good correspondence between model predicted

production rates and estimates provided by professional contractors for those types of

equipment. Dissimilarity was also rejected for sawyers and skidders operating in the ground-

based manual whole-tree system, as well as for feller-bunchers operating in the ground-based

mechanical whole-tree system.

The null hypothesis of dissimilarity was not rejected for the yarder and loader in the cable

manual whole-tree system; for the processor and loader operating in a ground-based manual

whole-tree system; for harvesters, forwarders, and loaders operating under a ground-based cut-

to-length system; or for skidders, loader, and the processor operating in a ground-based

mechanical whole-tree system (Table 3). Analysis of the OpCost predictions and survey-based

estimates in Figures 4–7 shows noticeable discrepancies in predicted production rates for

individual equipment within some of these systems, particularly the cut-to-length.




Discussion


The equations used in StHarvest (Hartsough et al. 2001), a progenitor to FRCS (Hartsough et

al. 2006) and OpCost have been widely used in a variety of studies to prioritize fuels

reduction treatments (Bolding et al. 2003; Waltz et al. 2014) and to predict biomass

harvesting costs at regional to national scales (Dykstra et al. 2009). When models are used to

make predictions with policy implications, it is important to evaluate the behavior of the

models used and to validate predictions against independent observations. Expert opinion

surveys are useful as a proxy for observed rates when empirical measurement proves

impractical or infeasible (Fried & Gilless 1989). Professional contract loggers are the pre-

eminent experts cap-able of estimating costs for the broad range of specific stand conditions

and harvest systems in the Pacific Northwest, and their cooperation enabled development of

this independent validation data set. The comparisons between OpCost predictions and expert

opinion are useful for informing model users about the accuracy of predicted fuel treatment

costs and how these vary among harvest systems and stand conditions. OpCost currently
                                                                                                                     57

includes six other harvesting systems that were not evaluated in this study due to logistical

constraints and our decision to focus on validating the most commonly used systems. This

evaluation of OpCost produced information about model performance with respect to both

costs associated with complete harvest systems and time requirements for individual

equipment components of those.

The latter provides additional insight into which kinds of equipment may be the greatest

potential sources of error and are deserving of additional new model development or

calibration.


The OpCost model performed reasonably well for predicting overall treatment costs for the

four complete harvesting systems evaluated in this study over a broad range of topographic

and stand conditions representative of conventional fuel reduction treatments deployed in the

northwestern United States. The null hypothesis that OpCost-simulated per-acre costs and

contractor-provided estimates for the same stands were dissimilar was rejected in each case.

However, users of OpCost should note where the model tends to predict the production rates

for individual component equipment within each system poorly. This likely reflects biases

associated with individual time studies used to develop OpCost, which have often been

developed under fairly narrow, localized stand conditions. For cable manual whole-tree

harvesting, many of the cost estimates generated by OpCost were higher than the expert

estimates when those estimates are low (less expensive treatments). Results for the individual

equipment components that comprise that system suggest that OpCost may also underestimate

sawyer production rate, which could account for some of the overstatement of costs. OpCost

also markedly over-predicted costs for the ground-based manual whole-tree system over the

full range of treatment costs by 27%. However, there appears to be some over-prediction of

skidding and sawing costs and underestimation of production rates for stands with higher

overall harvest costs (15% and 40% respectively). Estimates for the ground-based mechanical

whole-tree and ground-based cut-to-length systems do not strongly over- or under-predict, but

the ground-based cut-to-length system does have noticeably more variability in the prediction

error than the ground-based mechanical whole-tree system. However, the lower variability

shown with the ground-based mechanical whole-tree system could be partially attributed to the

lower overall costs for that system.

Because OpCost’s system-level cost estimate is an accumulation of the time estimates and cost

rates of the equipment involved, some of which may be over or under-predicted, the system

cost estimates can show less variation than is seen for the individual equipment types owing to

compensating errors. In addition to understanding OpCost performance relative to expert

opinion, users must be aware of inherent limitations. For example, given that production rates

can fluctuate greatly within a harvesting unit, and that OpCost does not account for within-unit

variability in conditions that could materially affect production rates, users assessing actual or

hypothetical fuel treatments on a specific piece of ground are advised to be selective about

linking OpCost to appropriately scaled stand inventory data. Large, heterogeneous units are

better partitioned into smaller, more homogeneous subunits for analysis with OpCost if

inventory data are available for each subunit. This is especially true when modeling treatments

in areas with mixed topography including both ground-based and cable operations. These and

several key model assumptions available in forthcoming documentation of the development of

OpCost are important to consider when using the model for research or to support operational

planning. Users should also understand that actual costs may depart from OpCost predictions

if OpCost’s inputs don’t accurately account for real world conditions.



We believe that when OpCost is implemented with representative inputs at the stand level or

for whole landscapes (e.g. for BioSum analyses), it will prove useful to researchers, land-

owners, and managers because it allows automation of treatment cost estimation in a way that

is linked seamlessly with forest inventory data and stand growth and yield. Integration with

outputs from the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS), e.g. via the summary metrics generated

by BioSum, significantly enhances the range of future simulation analyses that can reflect forest
                                                                                             65

succession, management and disturbance over decades, as well as a conscious strategy to

implement an intentional sequence of silvicultural activities, for example, to achieve forest

restoration through sustainable management (e.g. Fried et al. 2016), or to simulate impacts of

management policies on bioenergy markets. Although additional evaluation will be beneficial

for the harvest systems not included in this study, as well as any future systems that may be

added, these results confirm a reasonable correspondence between treatment costs predicted by

OpCost and those estimated by professional contractors. In general, referring to Figures 4– 7 in

this article in order to evaluate equipment-specific models is the easiest way to gauge the

expected quality of individual stand predictions when using OpCost for specialized projects.



Validation is an important step in many fields of research that utilize simulation modeling. It

provides model users with an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the analytical

tools they use. Model validation has been deployed infrequently in the analysis of production

and costs in forest operations and forest engineering. We have shown that validation using

equivalence testing, particularly when coupled with survey sampling of professional logging

contractors, provides a useful approach for evaluating logging cost models. Consistently

developed logging cost data from a range of operational conditions is often difficult to obtain

due to variability in methods used for cost-accounting by contractors and an understandable

reluctance to publicly share sensitive information about forest business transactions. Using

simulated stand conditions coupled with survey sampling proved to be a useful technique for

standardizing logging cost information received from contractors. Doing so allowed us to

validate OpCost across the range of stand and site conditions it is currently being used to make

predictions for. Further, this method makes it possible to draw on the expertise of many

contractors while still retaining a high level of consistency in the assumptions and methods used

to estimate treatment costs.

Conclusion


Formal comparison of the outputs from the OpCost model to expert estimates provided by

professional logging contractors provide support for the conclusion that total fuel treatment cost

predictions from OpCost are sufficiently accurate for the kinds of landscape-scale applications

for which the model is currently being used within BioSum. Overall OpCost model predictions

were typically within 20% of costs predicted by experts for the four common harvesting systems

we evaluated, across a range of stand and site conditions that are representative of expected

variability in fuel treatments in the Pacific Northwest United States, particularly on state and

federal lands. As noted, several equipment-specific models that make up some systems did not

predict production rates well across conditions outside those for which they were originally

developed. Consequently, model users should be cautious when using individual component

models to predict piecewise costs (e.g. only forwarding costs in a CTL system) when using

OpCost or BioSum for more localized or customized analyses. These sub-models should also

be targeted for future model improvement. In general, referring to Figures 4–7 in this article in

order to evaluate equipment-specific models is the easiest way to gauge the expected quality of

individual stand predictions when using OpCost for specialized projects.

                                         Conclusions


Two of the most effective methods of reducing the density and the risk of catastrophic fire in

western forests in the United States is by various physical active management. While many

management activities have economic gain from the sale of harvested materials, all of them

will have costs associated with the activities. To fully understand the economic impact of

forestry activities managers, researchers, and the public need to have an estimate of what the

operations will cost on the landscape. Previous designs at understanding the harvest costs

associated with forestry activities (FRCS, Hartsough, Fight, & Noordijk, 2006) have provided

vital economic information, but have lacked comparative testing and features required for

comparative testing for the BioSum project. The Forest Operations Lab at the University of

Idaho has addressed these needs with OpCost developed in the R statistical environment.


Developing the OpCost environment required identifying production equations related to the

harvesting systems most commonly used in modern day forestry. OpCost does include 11

different harvesting systems, but the system is easily updatable to include novel system

currently such as tethered harvesting, and remotely operated systems. This inherent flexibility

is an advantage because as logging operations develop more streamlined systems, OpCost will

be able to include these operations in a preconditioned analytical environment capable of

producing comparative numbers and graphics. One of the most important developments in

OpCost related to research and comparative analysis is its ability to simultaneously estimate

each potential operation given the stand conditions and provide the cheapest estimation in an

output table. By having the option to quickly compare different harvesting options appropriate
                                                                                               78

for the stand conditions allows the analyst to potentially pick a cheaper option to study

further.


To increase the faith in the numbers generated by the model, a sample dataset was needed to

compare the estimates that were generated. By using a mixed method surveying technique

involving mailed and face-to-face questionnaires representing simulated forest harvests with a

fuels reduction component. Each of the different adaptions of the forest operations were run

through OpCost and the generated estimates were compared to the cost estimates from

surveyed professional loggers. This analysis provided observations of occurring trends within

the model as well as the accuracy of the generated costs.

Ground-Based Mechanical Cut-to-Length

Contractor Costing Sheet
General Instructions:
For this questionnaire we ask that you bid on a forest harvesting operation that involves cut-
to-length tree harvesting using a ground-based system with a cut-to-length processor,
forwarder, and a loader at the landing. We want to know what you think the production rate
would be for each part of the harvesting system, as well as the cost per MBF for the different
components (e.g. sawing, yarding, processing, and loading). The stand information we
provide below includes a stand characteristics table with additional details such as slope,
topography, and yarding distances. After the map and harvest description you will find an
area to write your estimates, as well as a place to provide any additional details you were
thinking of while developing your estimate. For simplicity, assume that all the ground
illustrated is ground-based terrain only. Please do your best to estimate what it would cost
your crew to remove the material from the stand based on the information given. Also, please
do not include any move-in costs in your estimate.


Road Construction: We are assuming that all road construction is already complete with no
other road developments required. However, after looking at the map do you feel that more
road construction is required?
       Yes: Please provide the amount and possible cost._____________________________
       No: Please check:__________
