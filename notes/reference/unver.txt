                    Abstract

                    Wood-harvesting activities are conducted by contractors through tendering based on prices
                    determined by the amount of transported wood, land conditions and transport method param-
                    eters. Managers should determine the average completion time of the work and the base price
                    accurately to prevent both work and contractor losses prior to the tender and note the same in
                    the tender contract. Thus, prediction of productivity in wood production is of great importance
                    in the determination of the work duration and cost. In this context, the aim of the present study
                    was to determine the most accurate estimation model that would predict productivity (Pe)
                    based on log volume (Vt), route slope (P) and winching distance (D) in uphill cable skidding
                    activities with a drum tractor. In the current study, estimation models were developed that
                    use both linear regression through SPSS employing all data and the robust regression method
                    that minimizes the effect of outliers. Harvesting units were selected among pure spruce (Picea
                    orientalis (L.) Link) stands via the uphill cable-skidding method with a tractor in the North-
                    East of Turkey. Route slope, winching distance, log volume and time-consumption data were
                    collected in the chosen harvesting units and productivity prediction models were developed
                    with these data. In this study, the productivity estimation was performed using linear regres-
                    sion in SPSS and robust regression methods prepared in MATLAB environment. The coef-
                    ficients calculated by these methods were statistically tested, and it was determined that the
                    winching distance coefficient was insignificant with both methods. Thus, the productivity
                    estimation model was re-determined with both methods based on the slope and log volume
                    parameters, and the findings were compared. Additionally, the standard errors of the coeffi-
                    cients of both models were compared and it was concluded that the robust method was more
                    sensitive than the SPSS regression method.
