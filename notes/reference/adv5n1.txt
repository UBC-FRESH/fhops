     The study area in Block A was located
above a single haul road, and loader-
forwarding in a downhill direction was
prescribed (Figure 1).
     Block B was accessible to harvesting equip-
ment from in-block spur roads (Figure 2).
Loader-forwarding in a downhill direction,
and grapple yarding in both uphill and
downhill directions, were prescribed.
     In Block C, the steep ground beneath the
single haul road was prescribed for grapple
yarding in an uphill direction (Figure 3). A
portion of the study area with insufficient
deflection at the block’s backline was prescribed

     is grapple yarded.

        Implementation
         During the observed harvesting operation,
     FERIC identified conditions for successful
     and effective use of the Madill 144 and
     Cypress 7280 swing yarders and the Madill
     3800 loader-forwarder to harvest second-
     growth forests on steep slopes:
       • Productive and cost-efficient extraction
         with loader-forwarders and swing
         yarders requires careful layout of the
         block, detailed planning of all harvesting
         phases, and careful assignment of the
         extraction modes to the block area.
       • Low sensitivity of the total extraction
         and road construction costs in $/m³ to
         road spacing gives harvest planners a high
         degree of freedom in laying out blocks
         and designing road systems. Reasonable
         deviations from the optimum road
         spacing, dictated by terrain or stand
         features, should not unduly increase
         the combined extraction and road
         construction costs.
       • If the terrain and stand conditions permit,
         using feller-bunchers is recommended,
         particularly in areas with low stand and
         stem volumes. Bunches that are properly
         oriented, aligned, and sized will improve
         cycle load volumes, productivities, and
         costs of both extraction systems.
