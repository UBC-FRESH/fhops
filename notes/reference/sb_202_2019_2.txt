         Investment in thinning as part of forest management is generally for one of three purposes: improved
future stand growth and quality to produce higher value products for later final harvest, removal of fuels to
reduce fire risk or to meet ecological goals such as increasing biodiversity. The focus of this paper is on the
thinning operations in Australian pine and eucalypt plantations, which are almost exclusively conducted
by harvester-processors and forwarders. The Australian Forest Operations Research Alliance (AFORA) has
conducted research projects on assessing the productivity of harvester-processors and forwarders in pine and
eucalypt plantations in different sates/regions. All-time study data collected in different case studies have
been consolidated into a data base called ALPACA (Australian Logging Productivity and Cost Appraisal).
The data were used to develop the general productivity predicting models for harvester and forwarder based
on multiple regression modelling. Harvester productivity was mainly a function of tree volume. Forwarder
productivity was primarily a function of extraction distance. Slope has been included in the models as a
weighting factor based on three classes and namely <15%, from 15% to 25% and >25%.

                                          INTRODUCTION

       Australia’s industrial plantations consist of softwood species (1.03 million ha,
mostly pine) and hardwood plantations (0.98 million ha, mostly eucalypt) (ABARES,
2013). Thinning within forest management is generally done for one of three purposes:
improved future stand growth and quality to produce higher value products for later final
harvest, removal of fuels to reduce fire risk or to meet ecological goals such as increasing
biodiversity. Thinning materials are usually small size woods, such as pulp logs, large
branches and tops with limited industry uses. Pulp logs are used for pulp and paper
making purposes or, where bioenergy markets are strong, they can be used for bioenergy.
Large branches and tops generally do not meet industrial wood standards, thus are only
recovered for bioenergy applications. Because profit margin in thinning operations is
low, then it is essential to control the cost of operations. One of the suitable approaches
to control the cost is developing machine productivity and cost-predicting models for
the expected range of operating conditions. The focus of this research is on the thinning
operations in Australian pine and eucalypt plantations, which are almost exclusively
conducted by harvester-processors and forwarders.

       Studies on the application of the cut-to-length (CTL) system have been carried
out in commercial thinning in North America (Kellogg, Bettinger, 1994; Hossain, Olsen,
1998; Turner, Han, 2003; Kellogg, Spong, 2004) and Europe (Glode, 1999; Hanell et
al., 2000; Spinelli et al., 2002; Nurminen et al., 2006; Rottensteiner et al., 2008). In
Australia, the efficiency of a harvester-processor on a per-tonne basis was found to be
higher than the combination of feller-buncher and processor in native forest thinning
(Acuna, Kellogg, 2009).
       Many factors can affect productivity of harvesters and forwarders; they are
summarised in Table 1.

        Although several research projects have been conducted on assessing the productivity
and cost of harvester-processors and forwarders in pine and eucalypt plantations in different
states/regions in Australia (Acuna et al., 2017; Walsh, Strandgard, 2014; Ghaffariyan et
al., 2012; Ghaffariyan, Brown, 2013), there is still no general model which merges all
information to provide users with a benchmarking and predicting tool for productivity
estimation in thinning operations in Australia. This paper aimed to develop a general
productivity-predicting model for harvesters and forwarders in thinning operations and
test the significance impact of operational factors (tree size, extraction distance, etc.) on
machine productivity using multilinear regression modelling.


                               MATERIALS AND METHODS
Modelling of thinning operations with ALPACA
      The tool ALPACA (Australian Logging Productivity and Cost Appraisal),
developed by the Australian Forest Operations Research Alliance (AFORA), was used to

                                                  14
generate a productivity model for a harvester and a forwarder, which are commonly used
in softwood and hardwood thinning operations. ALPACA is an Excel-based tool used
to model and estimate harvest productivity and costs under different scenarios, assist
planners to match harvesting systems to forest conditions, assess the impact of factors on
productivity and cost and as a control tool to compare planned and actual productivity
of harvesting systems, among others. The structure of the ALPACA tool is the same as
that of the tool IRLPACA described in Murphy et al. (2010). Input parameters include
harvest area, relocation distance, stand details (merchantable volume and trees to be
removed per hectare, species), harvest type (e.g. clearfelling, thinning), working hours per
year, harvesting system (e.g. cut-to-length, tree length) and machine hourly productivity
and costs (Figure 1). As outputs, the tool provides daily production (m3 and tonnes), cost
per m3 and cost per tonne by machine and for the whole system, as well as days to log
the harvest unit. In addition, the tool allows the user to balance the system, i.e. to find
the mix of felling/processing and extraction equipment that achieves the least harvesting
cost (Acuna, Strandgard, 2017).
       Productivity models in ALPACA have been developed for the most common
ground-based harvesting systems existing across Australia from more than 200 time

studies. Table 1 shows the ground-based systems included in the ALPACA tool, including
the equipment for felling, processing, extraction and loading. Softwood and hardwood
thinning operations are usually conducted using a harvester for felling the trees and
processing the stems into logs (Figure 2), a forwarder to collect, load and extract the logs
to roadside (Figure 3) and a dedicated loader to load the logs onto trucks (last system in
Table 2 which is the one considered in this study). Eventually, the forwarder also can do
the loading, although this option was not considered in the study.

Models for thinning operations developed with ALPACA
       Productivity models in ALPACA, including those for thinning operations, are
derived mainly from piece count studies but also from detailed time studies. In piece
count studies, the number of trees, stems or logs produced in a certain period of time
(e.g. one hour), along with their average volume, are recorded. These figures are then used
to compute the productivity of harvesting equipment in m3 or tonnes per productive
machine hour (PMH). In this study, all delays that occurred during data collection were
not considered as part of the productive time, which in harvesting studies, is referred as
to PMH0. Piece and count studies represent a quick way to estimate the productivity of a
piece of harvesting equipment and system, as they can easily be replicated across a range
of forest and operational conditions (Acuna et al., 2012). These data points can then be

                                                         16
plotted and used to develop predictive models mainly by means of simple or multilinear
regression techniques.
        In the case of detailed time studies, the goal is to describe the relationship between
the time required to perform a particular phase of work (time or work element) and
the factors, e.g. tree volume, slope, tree form, etc.), influencing the work (Acuna et
al., 2017). This relationship is usually expressed in the form of a simple or multilinear
regression model. In addition, detailed time studies are used to compare the productivity
of two or more different work methods and machines (Acuna, Kellogg, 2009). They
provide elemental detail, can link results to site and operating conditions (e.g. piece size,
terrain slope) and they can pinpoint inefficiencies.
        Data in detailed time studies are recorded at cycle level and include all work
elements in each cycle. In the case of harvesters, some common work elements collected
during these studies are moving, positioning to cut a tree, felling, processing, clearing
debris and travelling. Likewise, work elements for the forwarder include travelling empty,
travelling loaded, loading and unloading. Once a regression model is developed for each
work element, these are added up to get a model by cycle, which is then converted to a
productivity model.
        All time study data collected by the Australian Forest Operations Research Alliance
(AFORA) in different case studies across Australia have been consolidated into a data base,
which includes, among others, the time and location of data collection, machine type, place
of data collection, site specifications (e.g. slope, average tree size, etc.) and measured machine
productivity (from piece count or detailed time studies). The data base is the basis of general
productivity-predicting models for harvesters and forwarders based on multilinear regression
modelling included in ALPACA. For harvesters and forwarders, it is assumed that machine
productivity is primarily a function of tree volume and extraction distance, respectively.
Slope has been included as a productivity-reduction factor based on three classes including:
<15%, from 15% to 25% and >25%. When working on ground slope varying from 15% to
25%, the productivity will drop by 15%, while for slopes exceeding 85%, the productivity is
estimated to decrease by 25%. The productivity-predicting models are presented in tables and
Excel-based graphs for further spatial analysis at a national level.
        For determining the cost per tonne, hourly machine costs (AUD$/PMH) were
obtained from ALPACA and AFORA’s standard machine-costing models, which use
standard costing methodologies used in harvesting studies (Miyata and Steinhilb 1981,
Ackermann et al. 2014). The input parameters to calculate hourly costs in ALPACA are
shown in Figure 4.

                                          RESULTS

        Harvester’s productivity and cost prediction
        For harvesters, the machine productivity as a function of tree volume (over bark)
is presented in Equation 1:

       Productivity [m3/PMH0]=48.971*Tree volume [m3]0.6245                          (1)

             Fig. 4. Input parameters used in ALPACA to calculate machine hourly costs.


        The predicted productivity and cost for felling and processing trees using a
medium-sized harvester working on slopes less than 15% is presented in Table 3. Larger
tree size will result in higher machine productivity and reduced costs. As an indicator, if
tree size increases from 0.5 m3 to 1.0 m3 the machine productivity will increase from 32.1
m3/PMH0 to 48.2 m3/PMH0 (free delay productive machine hours), which consequently
would drop the cost from 7.4 $/m3 to 4.9 $/m3 (34% cost reduction assuming an hourly
cost of 236.9 $/PMH).

       Harvester productivity can also be impacted by slope. When harvesters work on
steeper slopes (above 15%), the movement between trees and positioning the machine
will require more time to be done safely, which will impact productivity negatively
(Figure 5).
       These models are implemented in the ALPACA tool (Figure 6). Additional factors
(such as tree form, terrain and operator) can be included to adjust the productivity
predictions made by the tool. In the figure, the bands correspond to variations in
productivity of +-10% around the prediction curve.

Forwarder’s productivity and cost prediction
       Two general models are included in the ALPACA tool, one for small forwarders
(14 t capacity) and one for large forwarders (20 t capacity). Large-sized forwarders
(12-18 t capacity) are commonly used in Australian native forest thinning operations
to transport some of the large trees that are removed during the operations (Acuna,
Kellogg, 2009).

       Productivity [m3/PMH0]=87.65/Extraction distance [m]0.126                            (3)

       Forwarding distance is the most significant factor impacting forwarder’s
productivity based on the model. Increasing forwarding distance increases the travel time
of the machine, resulting in lower productivity for the forwarder. In addition, larger
machines (20 t) have higher hourly operating cost than smaller machines (14 t) but can
be more productive with larger load sizes.
       Table 4 presents the summary of predicted productivity and cost of two forwarders
for forwarding distances ranging from 100 m to 800 m on flat terrains (slope< 10%).
From the table, the productivity and cost of a large forwarder for extracting logs at
average distance of 100 m is predicted as 49.1 m3/PMH0 and 5.6 $/m3, respectively. As
extraction distance increases to 400 m the productivity is reduced by up to 16% (41.2
m3/PMH0) increasing the cost to 6.7 $/m3.
       Slope of forwarding trails may impact the travelling time between the stand and
road side (landing). When forwarding on ground with slope increasing from 10% to
20%, the productivity drops by up to 75% and up to 85% as slopes increase beyond
20%. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the impact of forwarding distance on the productivity of
forwarders for three different slope classes.

                                      DISCUSSION

        The harvester productivity models in this study are based around the most
common productivity-influencing variable for harvesters: tree size. Consistent with
previous studies, the developed model shows a non-linear increase in productivity with
increasing tree size (Kärä et al., 2004; Visser, Spinelli, 2012; Walsh, Strandgard, 2014;
Ghaffariyan et al., 2015; Baek et al., 2017; Acuna et al., 2017). Given the shape of the
harvesting productivity model and the fact that it shows an ongoing increasing trajectory,
it is understood that the tree sizes included in the study area were well within the technical
limits of the harvester.
        The difference between predicted productivity in this general model versus other
studies is likely influenced by the range of tree sizes included in the study area, tree form,
operator experience and other site conditions, e.g. slope and roughness. Because forking
of the stem did not present as a significant variable, like it did in the Acuna et al. (2017)
case study, it is expected that the trees in the trial had significantly better form with less
forking of the stems present. Given there were no specific issues observed during the
study, operator experience and terrain conditions re likely to have had minimal, if any
impact on the general model.
        The productivity-predicting model of forwarders in this study is consistent with
other studies (Tufts, Brinker, 1993; Kuitto et al., 1994; Nurminen et al., 2006) where
extraction distance was used as an independent variable. As expected, increasing distance
resulted in increased extraction time and reduced productivity. The predicted productivity
for small forwarder falls within the range (from 8 to 36 m3/PMH0) reported by previous
studies (Gullberg, 1997; Martin dos Santos et al., 1995; Saunders, 1996; Geolia et al.,
1999; Horvat et al., 1990; Cordeo et al., 2006, Baek et al., 2017).
        The productivity predicted by model for large forwarders is slightly higher than
published international studies, which might be due to the larger size of machine (or
other opreational factors, such as larger load volume, flatter terrains, etc.) assumed in our
modelling. For both the small forwarders and the large forwarders, slope was found to have
a significant impact on the productivity. For both, the productivity was typically reduced
by 8 to 15 m3/PMH0 with the forwarder likely having to travel slower either due to
climbing the reverse slope or to operate safely across the slope. The size of some of the trees
removed during thinning operations in Australian native forests, calls for large-capacity
(18-20 t) forwarders. These operations require careful planning to ensure productive and
safe harvesting and extraction operations. Commercial thinning is normally conducted
using an “outrow and bay” method. In this method, a whole row (~4.5 m strip) or access
track is removed. For ease of working, thinning machinery often requires that outrows are
at right angles to the contour. In natural regrowth, outrows are a maximum of 4.5. m wide
and bays a minimum of 12 m wide (Acuna, Kellogg, 2009).
        The general productivity-predicting models in this study are useful tools to
harvesting managers and contactors for controlling and predicting the forwarders’ and
harvesters’ productivity (and cost) in their operations. The size of the machine (forwarder

                                             22
studied in this trial) would impact the productivity and cost which needs to be considered
by industry users in operation planning. Care should be taken because these predicting-
productivity models were developed based on limited time studies. There is an error
of estimation of regression models which needs to be considered when applying these
models. In addition, to the error of regression models, the models’ application should
be limited to the range of the parameters (tree size, extraction distance, etc.) used in this
study. If operations/stands conditions are different, one would need to collect further
time study data and update the predicting models to match with the working conditions.

                                         CONCLUSIONS

       The results of this study indicated that statistically it is possible to merge different
time study data to develop a general model. The general models, developed for predicting
productivity of harvesters and forwarders, were significant and provided consistent and
reasonable outcomes. These models could be used for benchmarking work productivity
of similar harvesting operations in Australia. In addition to tree size and forwarding
distance, the slope factor was added to the developed models, which may be useful for
industry users operating in various terrains.
