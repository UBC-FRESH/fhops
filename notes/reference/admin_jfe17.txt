minimizing the sum of road costs and skidding costs to
the landowner. Sessions (1986) examined the ramifications
of income tax rules on road spacing issues. Thompson
(1988) considered road spacing from the perspective of a
logging contractor wanting to maximize profits. Sessions
and Yeap (1989) examined simultaneous allocation of equip-
ment and road spacing from a contractor’s point of view.
Recently, Stewart (2003) revisited these ideas.

   The classic road spacing problem of Matthews assumes
that the marginal cost of skidding is constant with respect
to distance and that road spacing is a continuous vari-
able. Starnes (1985) used Matthews’ least cost approach
to estimate the optimal shovel logging road spacing using
data from his production study at Yakutat, Alaska. Al-
though it may be possible to approximate the shovel log-
ging process using these assumptions, we believe more
insight can be developed by a process-based approach
that more closely reflects the elements of shovel logging.

crete landings. There are two common shovel logging
patterns. The first is a serpentine pattern (Figure 2) where
the shovel begins at the back of the unit and works its
way forward accumulating the wood in rows, or racks, and
moving the rows, or racks, forward. Sometimes an initial
pass is made along the road to straighten the logs that will
ultimately form the base of the log deck [6]. The serpen-
tine pattern is most commonly used on flat terrain with
long logs. An alternative pattern, more often used in slop-
ing terrain (up to 40% slope) or with full trees is to travel
on trails perpendicular to the road (Figure 3.) This paper
analyzes the long-log, serpentine skidding pattern.


FORMULATION

   We assume the objective for the planner is to either (1)
minimize the sum of road plus shovel logging costs for the
landowner or (2) maximize the profit for the shovel logger.
We also assume the roads have not been constructed and
once constructed will be used for this single entry. Addi-
tionally, it is assumed the terrain is gentle with shovel
logging long logs to both sides of the road. From an op-
eration’s viewpoint, the assumptions are: one, that the
shovel must complete its yarding pattern and return to the      Figure 3. Vertical pattern for forwarding tree length or full
