to draw conclusions re,garding produ,ctivity model,s and tre,nds in th,e literature.

If the review were to be,conducted ag,"ain, or if a sim",ilar revi,ew were,to be conducted
,,,,,
for other types of m,"achinery, so",me aspects s,hould b,e chang,ed to improve
,,,,,
"reproducibility, transpa","rency, and to",ascertain exh,austivene,ss. The,aforementioned

points should obviou,sly be consi,"dered, which",would,make th,e review more
,,,,,
exhaustive and compre,hensive. Furt,"her, it would",be prefer,able if t,he review was a
,,,,,
systematic literature re,view (SLR).,This review c,annot be,classifi,ed as a SLR as
,,,,,
several parts of the met,hodology for,SLRs were o,mitted. In,this rev,"iew, some parts"
,,,,,
of the SALSA framew,ork were not,as detailed as,they are,in SLRs,(Mengist et al.
,,,,,
2020). One aspect of t,he SALSA fr,amework that,could h,ave bee,n more detailed
,,,,,
was the inclusion criter,"ia, particularl",y inclusion cri,terion 5:,The pub,lication focuses
,,,,,
on forest operations an,d pertains to,"harvesters, fel",ler-bunc,"hers, or",harwarders and
,,,,,
could possibly contain,productivity,models. This,criterion,could b,e interpreted as
,,,,,
somewhat broad and s,"ubjective, rel",ying on the a,uthor's o,wn inter,pretation of the
,,,,,
likelihood that the publ,ications inclu,ded productiv,ity mode,"ls, based",on the title and
,,,,,
abstract of the publicat,ion. Consequ,"ently, a bias w",as possib,ly induc,ed which could
,,,,,
have affected the outc,ome. It wou,"ld, therefore,",be bene,ficial fo,r future similar
,,,,,
reviews to more prec,isely define,this type of i,nclusion,criterio,n to make the
,,,,,

and transparency of the,review.,,,,
,,,,,
One aspect of the SAL,SA framewor,k that was ent,irely om,itted wa,s a visualization
,,,,,
of the exclusion of pub,"lications, suc",h as those in F,ernánde,z del Am,o et al. (2018).
,,,,,
A flow diagram could,have been c,reated to visu,alize inc,lusion a,nd exclusion of
,,,,,
publications. Instead o,f piling all the,eligible publ,ications t,ogether,", separate tables"
,,,,,
or flowcharts should h,ave been cre,ated to show,how ma,ny eligi,ble publications
,,,,,
were identified in each,"database, an",d how many w,ere excl,uded for,each exclusion
,,,,,
criterion. Implementin,g this approa,ch would have,increas,ed the tr,ansparency and
,,,,,
reproducibility of the r,eview.,,,,
,,,,,
Meta-analysis could b,e performed i,f a similar re,view wer,e to be,conducted. In a
,,,,,
"meta-analysis, the res",ults of sever,al publication,s are co,"mbined,",and statistical
,,,,,
analysis is performe,d to identif,"y patterns, d",raw con,clusion,"s, and resolve"
,,,,,
uncertainties in researc,h. Results tha,t are not disce,rnible fr,om a sin,gle study could
,,,,,
be discerned from sev,eral through,meta-analysis,(Russo,2007).,There are meta-
,,,,,
analyses available reg,arding factor,s’ effect on h,arvestin,g produ,"ctivity, such as"
,,,,,
those on ground-base,d harvesting,by Louis et,al. (202,2) and,on cable-yarder
,,,,,
logging by Böhm & K,anzian (202,3). While Lou,is et al.,(2022),covered several
,,,,,
crucial factors for full,y mechanized,"harvesting, s",ome vari,ables w,ere omitted due
