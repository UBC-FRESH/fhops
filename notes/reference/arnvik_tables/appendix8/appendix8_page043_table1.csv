There was a diffe,rence in,whether the mo,dels include,d,or excluded de,lays. In 379
,,,,,,
"models, the dela",ys were,excluded from,the model.,D,elays were inc,luded in 39
,,,,,,
models and in the,"se, eight",models used a f,actor of 1.2 t,o,substitute the a,ctual delays
,,,,,,
in the study. Thi,rteen m,odels included,delays short,er,than 15 minu,"tes, and 18"
,,,,,,
models included,the del,ays in the actu,al study. Fu,rt,"her, whether",delays were

Coefficients of d,etermina,tion were often,reported for,m,odels and the,ir predictive
ability varied con,siderably,(Appendix 11),. R2 and R2-a,dj,usted values w,ere reported
for 303 and 115,"models,",respectively. F,or 32 models,",",R2 and R2-adj,usted values
were both report,"ed, while",36 models lac,ked both R2,an,d R2-adjusted,values. The
coefficients of de,terminat,ion R2 and R2-,adjusted valu,e,s ranged from,0.032-0.998
,,,,,,
"and 0.007-0.99, r",espectiv,"ely. Moreover,",the presence,o,f information,of statistical
,,,,,,
significance for,models,varied consid,erably. For,1,"41 models, th",e statistical
,,,,,,
significance of on,ly predic,tors was report,"ed, while the",st,atistical signifi,cance of the
,,,,,,
model was report,ed for 2,00 models. Ho,"wever, only",20,models were,tested using
