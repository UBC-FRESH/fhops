and the publicati,on did not ac,tually exp,licitly provide inform,ation on whether they
,,,,
included delays,or not is prob,lematic if,the model were to be,applied in harvesting.
,,,,
Even if a publica,tion has prov,ided clear,information that the,"model included delays,"
,,,,
there is still a p,ossibility th,at the mod,el might not accurat,ely predict the actual
,,,,
outcome due to t,he erratic na,ture of del,ays. Spinelli & Visse,r (2008) conducted 34
,,,,
studies and dela,ys constitute,"d, on aver","age, 28.9% of the tot",al scheduled machine
,,,,
time. This sugg,ests that dela,ys can co,nstitute a relatively b,ig portion of the total
,,,,
scheduled time.,Delays shou,ld thus be,incorporated into mo,"dels with caution, and"
,,,,
the data of delay,s should be,based on l,ong-term studies (Sp,inelli & Visser 2008).
,,,,
"Fortunately, it a",ppears that re,searchers,prefer to omit delays,from models and only
,,,,
include producti,ve time sinc,e the majo,rity of models (89.5,%) were structured in
,,,,
this manner. Thi,s is similar t,o the resul,ts of Lindroos & Cav,alli (2016) and Böhm
,,,,
& Kanzian (202,3).,,,

,,,,
Some weakness,es can be fou,nd in this,review that could hav,"e been improved and,"
,,,,
"ultimately, have",given better,and mor,e comprehensive res,ults. Even though this
,,,,
study covered a,relatively v,oluminous,"dataset, more public",ations could probably
,,,,
have been ident,ified. A wid,er range,of databases could h,ave been searched to
,,,,
identify publicat,ions. Snowb,alling tech,niques could also ha,"ve been used, in terms"
,,,,
of using the ref,erence lists f,rom identi,fied publications to,track down additional
,,,,
ones. Furthermo,"re, the time",interval f,or publications consi,dered eligible for this
,,,,
review could ha,ve been exte,nded to in,clude more publicati,ons. More data could
,,,,
possibly have alt,ered the outc,ome to so,"me extent. However,",given the large number
,,,,
of publications,already inclu,ded in thi,"s review, it is uncer",tain how significantly
,,,,
these additional,publications,would hav,e affected the results,.
,,,,
Another limitati,on is the choi,ce of searc,h strings applied in d,atabases. More search
,,,,
strings could ha,ve been adde,d througho,ut the study such as,"“on-board-computer”,"
,,,,
"“OBC”, and ot",her similar,strings to,favor follow-up st,"udies. Likewise, it is"
,,,,
somewhat uncle,ar whether t,he search s,trings had a propens,ity for time studies. It
,,,,
was uncertain i,f more publ,ications t,hat used follow-up,data could have been
,,,,
identified with m,ore compre,hensive se,"arch strings, since on",ly a limited number of
,,,,
publications of t,hat sort were,identified,.,
,,,,
The decision to r,efine the sea,rch results,in Web of Science w,ith the filter “forestry”
,,,,
is somewhat que,stionable. Lo,"gically, al",l studies eligible for t,his review should have
,,,,
been in this re,"search area,","however,",this might not be,"the case. Thus, the"
,,,,
exhaustiveness,of this revie,w is unce,"rtain. However, give",n the relatively large
