expected to promo,te a wider use of,them. For exam,"ple, time",studies,are usually
,,,,,
relatively expensiv,e and time-consu,ming to conduct c,ompared t,o follo,w-up studies
,,,,,
(e.g. Olivera et al.,2016; Brewer et a,l. 2018; Liski et,al. 2020).,Howev,"er, there are"
,,,,,
also certain negat,ive aspects to f,ollow-up studies,which c,ould o,utweigh the
,,,,,
positives and expl,ain why research,ers might be he,sitant to c,onduc,t them. The
,,,,,
"dataset can, for ins","tance, be of lowe",r detail (Eriksson,& Lindro,os 20,14). Another
,,,,,
important limitatio,n might be that f,ollow-up data fro,m regular,opera,tions require
,,,,,
that the data owne,r (e.g. a forest co,mpany) allows th,e use and,publi,cation of the
,,,,,
"data. Further, the a",bsence of direct o,bservations in the,field or by,came,ra also limits
,,,,,
the ability to captu,re different work,elements’ time. S,ince a su,bstanti,al number of
,,,,,
publications were,conducted as wor,k element level s,"tudies, th",ese mi,ght not have
,,,,,
been possible to pe,rform with follo,w-up data and is,likely the,reason,for the low
,,,,,
number of follow-,up studies. Moreo,"ver, follow-up st",udies are,almost,exclusive to
,,,,,
CTL-machinery w,ith sensors and,processing head,s. A subs,tantial,number of
,,,,,
publications studi,ed FT-machinery,", possibly expla",ining the,small,number of
,,,,,
follow-up studies.,"However, the ratio",of time studies to,follow-u,p studi,"es, and CTL-"
,,,,,
machinery to FT-m,"achinery, differ c",onsiderably.,,,
,,,,,
Regarding equipm,ent type used for,modelling purpo,"ses, some",differ,ences to the
,,,,,
results of Koŝir et,al. (2015) were,observed. Handhe,ld-compu,ters w,ere the most
,,,,,
frequently used in,this review’s ide,ntified publicatio,ns compa,red to,"their results,"
,,,,,
where studyboards,with stopwatches,were the most p,rominent.,Anoth,er difference
,,,,,
is the use of video,"cameras, where t",hey appeared mo,re frequen,tly in t,his review’s
,,,,,
"results. However, i",t is also importan,t to note the abse,nce of inf,ormati,on regarding
,,,,,
equipment types,in this review.,Thirty-three pu,blications,did,not provide
,,,,,
information on eq,"uipment type, an",d this lack of inf,ormation,could,significantly
,,,,,
affect the results.,"Furthermore, sim",ilarly to Koŝir e,t al. (201,"5), a",bias towards
,,,,,
European publicati,ons was induced,"in this study, ye",t some dif,ferenc,es were still
,,,,,
observed. For exa,"mple, in African,","Northern, South","ern, and",Weste,rn European

The most common,independent va,riable in models,was piece,"size,",which is no

surprise given the,well-known rela,tionship of piece,size and,produ,ctivity (e.g.
