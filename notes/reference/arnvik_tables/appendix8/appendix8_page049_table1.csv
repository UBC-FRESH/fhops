4.4 Operator,s,,,,
,,,,,
The number of oper,ators used in p,ublications,and their e,xperience,varied widely.
,,,,,
The human factor in,forest operatio,n has been s,tudied wid,ely and is k,nown to affect
,,,,,
productivity (e.g. Pu,rfürst & Erler,2011; Hägg,ström & L,indroos 20,16; Malinen et
,,,,,
al. 2018). To negat,"e this factor,",a large sam,ple of oper,ators wou,ld be required
,,,,,
(Bergstrand 1987).,To study a lar,ge quantity,of operato,rs in a sin,gle time study
,,,,,
would be unfeasible,. It would be to,o time-cons,"uming and,","therefore,",too expensive.
,,,,,
The majority of tim,e studies in th,is review s,tudied one,or a few o,perators. This
,,,,,
could be somewhat,limiting due t,o the individ,ual and int,er-individ,ual differences
,,,,,
in productivity. In th,e study by Pur,fürst & Erle,"r (2011), a",difference i,n productivity
,,,,,
of a factor of 1.8 for,experienced o,perators was,observed a,nd the hum,"an factor was,"
,,,,,
"after stem volume,",the second m,ost importa,nt factor t,o influence,productivity.
,,,,,
"Consequently, when",conducting a,time study w,ith only on,e or a few,"operators, and"
,,,,,
even though the stan,d characteristi,cs are very s,"imilar, the r",esulting pr,oductivity and
,,,,,
productivity models,could presuma,bly be diffe,rent. To neg,ate the pos,sible variation
,,,,,
in operator perform,"ance, which c",ould affect,values of p,roductivity,"models, long"
,,,,,
term data collected,automatically,could be us,ed (Strandg,ard et al. 2,013). Spinelli
,,,,,
& De Arruda Moura,(2019) used fo,llow-up dat,asets from,120 operat,"ors, which was"
,,,,,
the largest number o,f operators cle,arly stated to,be used fo,r developin,g productivity
,,,,,
models observed in,this review.,"However, e",ven thoug,h no actua,l number was
,,,,,
provided in Eriksso,n & Lindroos (,"2014), their",study used,data from,more than 400
,,,,,
"harvesters, most of",which can be,expected to,have been,operated b,y at least two
,,,,,
"operators. Hence, t",hese types of,follow-up,studies ut,ilizing lar,ge number of
,,,,,
operators are likely,to reduce the,possible bia,s induced b,y differenc,es in operator
,,,,,
performances.,,,,,
,,,,,
4.5 Delays,,,,,
,,,,,
"In total, 379 models",predicted pro,ductivity or,time consu,mption ex,cluding delays
,,,,,
and 39 models incl,uded delays. D,elays may o,ccur errati,"cally, and t",he occurrence
,,,,,
of delays differ depe,nding on work,conditions,and machin,e types. In,a shorter time
,,,,,
"study, it can, therefo","re, be difficult",to precisely,determine,the extent,of delays with
,,,,,
certainty and the ap,plicability of t,hese delay ti,mes to oth,er studies.,"Consequently,"
,,,,,
instead of including,the actual del,ays observe,d in a stud,"y, factors",may instead be
,,,,,
implemented that h,ave been devel,oped from,several lon,ger time st,udies (Spinelli
,,,,,
& Visser 2008). Eig,ht models in t,his review h,ad such fac,tors instea,d of the actual
,,,,,
delays observed in t,he studies due,to the relati,vely short,period the,machines were
,,,,,
"studied. Moreover,",in four model,"s, whether",the depend,ent variab,le included or
,,,,,
excluded delay time,could not be d,educed wit,h complete,certainty. I,t could simply
,,,,,
be that the author of,this review co,uld not dedu,ce it. How,"ever, if this",is not the case
