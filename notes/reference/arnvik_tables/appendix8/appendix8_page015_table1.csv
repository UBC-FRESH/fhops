2024). Addi,"tionally, models c",an be used to,determine s,"alaries, pa","yments, and"
,,,,,
calculate cos,ts of harvesting (N,uutinen et al. 20,08). Models,can also b,e utilized for
,,,,,
evaluation of,new machines an,d entire new sys,tems (Liski e,t al. 2020,). In addition
,,,,,
"to this, oper",ators can be evalua,"ted, and compa",risons can b,e conducte,d to explore
,,,,,
the effect of,age and training on,productivity (M,alinen et al.,2018). Sim,"ilarly, stand"
,,,,,
and terrain,parameters’ effect,on productivit,y can be stu,died by a,nalyzing the
,,,,,
relationship,between these and,productivity wi,th models (V,isser & Sp,inelli 2012).
,,,,,
To develop,productivity mode,"ls, data is nee",ded which i,s usually,collected by
,,,,,
performing,studies dedicated f,or this purpos,e (e.g. Erikss,on & Lin,droos 2014;

The purpose,of a work study is t,o determine the,relationship b,etween in,put variables
,,,,,
and output v,"ariables, while als",o assessing the,influence of,other vari,ables on the
,,,,,
relationship,(Acuna et al. 2012),. Work studies,in forestry h,ave been c,onducted for
,,,,,
more than,a century and the,ir primary obj,ective in fo,rest work,", improving"
,,,,,
operational e,"ffectiveness, have",been largely unc,hanged since,they origi,nated (Koŝir
,,,,,
et al. 2015).,"However, Koŝir et",al. (2015) also,emphasized,that the sc,ope of work
,,,,,
studies has w,"idened, and site im",pact assessmen,t are often in,cluded tod,ay.

In forest re,"search, work stud",ies can typical,ly be catego,rized into,two types:
,,,,,
comparative,studies and correl,ation studies. I,n comparativ,"e studies,",comparisons
,,,,,
are made b,"etween, for insta","nce, two or m",ore method,s or mac,hines. Other
,,,,,
influencing,"factors, such as w","ork conditions,",remain the,same. In,"comparison,"
,,,,,
correlation s,tudies assess the,relationship bet,ween produ,ctivity and,changes in
,,,,,
influential fa,"ctors, such as tree",size (Lindroos,2010). Con,ducting ti,me studies is
,,,,,
one common,way to study the,relationship be,tween produ,ctivity and,influencing
,,,,,
factors (Björ,heden et al. 1995).,,,,
,,,,,
A time stud,y aims to study th,e relationship b,etween inpu,ts and out,puts under a
,,,,,
relatively bri,ef period (Eriksso,n & Lindroos 2,014). It is th,e predomi,nant method
,,,,,
for assessing,work time in fores,t operations (S,zewczyk & S,owa 2017,). Depending
,,,,,
on the detai,l desired in the ti,"me study, the o",utput variabl,e can be,measured in
,,,,,
different lev,"els, i.e. having d",ifferent observ,ational units,. Producti,vity can be
,,,,,
evaluated on,"plot, shift, work","cycle, or wor",k element le,vel. Whe,n evaluating
,,,,,
productivity,"on plot level, the",time needed to,harvest the e,ntire plot,and the total
,,,,,
outcome is n,oted. For shift lev,"el, the time and",output for t,he entire s,hift is noted.
,,,,,
When more,detailed results,"are desired, re",searchers m,ay study,a machine’s
,,,,,
performance,on work cycle or,work element l,evel. A work,cycle is c,omprised of
,,,,,
several repet,itive work elemen,ts (Acuna et al.,2012). This,can be ill,ustrated with
