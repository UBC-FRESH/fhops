,,,,
Appendix 7 explains th,e abbreviations for,dependent variabl,es used in the mode,"ls, which are"
,,,,
shown in Appendix 8. I,"n Appendix 8, the “",Model” column co,ntains the models. In,"this column,"
,,,,
an uppercase letter indi,"cates a variable, wh",ereas a lowercase,letter indicates a pa,rameter. The
,,,,
variables are shown in,"Appendix 9, and the",parameters in Ap,pendix 10. Informati,on regarding
,,,,
coefficients of determ,"ination, statistical","significance, obs","ervational unit, and",number of
,,,,
observations are shown,in Appendix 11.,,,
,,,,
"To use a model, one sh",ould first check the,models and their,dependent variables,in Appendix
,,,,
8. If the abbreviations,for dependent varia,"bles are unclear,",see Appendix 7 for,clarification.
,,,,
"Next, consult Appendix",8 to see which varia,bles are included,"in a model. Then, go",to Appendix
,,,,
10 to apply parameters,for the model.,,,
