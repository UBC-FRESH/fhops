the same operat,or. They,studied the impact,different o,perators had on,productivity
,,,,,
using data colle,cted fro,m a period of more,than three,years. It was co,"ncluded that,"
,,,,,
irrespective of t,ree vol,ume and relative to,the mean,productivity lev,"el, the worst"
,,,,,
and best operat,or perfo,rmed at levels of 56,% and 125,"%, respectively",. This shows
,,,,,
a difference bet,ween ab,solute values of a fa,ctor of 2.2,. Purfürst & Erle,r (2011) also
,,,,,
concluded that,the oper,ator accounted for,37.3% of,the variance in,"productivity,"
,,,,,
ranking just be,low tree,size in importance,. Furtherm,"ore, although o",perators can
,,,,,
have a big imp,act on p,"roductivity, there is",no literat,ure that specifie,s how many
,,,,,
operators resear,chers ty,pically study when,developi,ng productivity,models. It is
,,,,,
known that rese,archers,generally select ex,perienced,operators (Koŝir,"et al. 2015),"
,,,,,
but the number,of opera,tors applied in such,studies is,unknown.,
,,,,,
Further studies,have be,en conducted that,highlighted,the importanc,e of operator
,,,,,
age and experi,ence. F,"or example, Maline",n et al. (,2018) performe,d a study to
,,,,,
examine the cor,relation,between operator s,"kill, age, an",d productivity f,or harvesters
,,,,,
in Finland. In th,"e study,",it was inferred that,operators,between the age,s of 40 to 45
,,,,,
with at least 1,6 years,of experience had,the highe,"st productivity,",while older
,,,,,
operators indic,ated a s,mall decline in pr,oductivity.,It was also co,ncluded that
,,,,,
operators with,20 year,s of experience had,a relative,productivity of,"1.07, while"
,,,,,
operators with 3,years o,f experience had a,relative pr,oductivity of 0.8,"7, indicating"
,,,,,
a 23.6% higher,relative,productivity for ope,rators wit,h 20 years of ex,perience.
,,,,,
While there are,many fa,ctors that can affec,t productiv,"ity, and tree siz",e often being
,,,,,
the most import,ant one (,e.g. Visser & Spine,lli 2012; L,ahrsen et al. 202,2; Schmiedel
,,,,,
"et al. 2022), the",re is no,literature that have,compiled,"and analyzed,","overall, what"
,,,,,
factors research,ers have,chosen to incorpora,te in prod,uctivity models,and how well
,,,,,
these factors ac,tually ha,ve predicted produ,ctivity acr,oss multiple pub,lications. By
,,,,,
identifying and,compili,ng the models it is p,ossible to,identify what fac,tors resulted
,,,,,
in models with,high o,r low predictive ca,"pabilities,",as well as iden,tify possible
,,,,,
research gaps i,n the li,"terature, i.e. what f",actors hav,e already been,studied and
,,,,,
incorporated in,models.,"Additionally, there",is no publ,ication that has e,"xamined, on"
,,,,,
"a larger scale,",whether,there is a differenc,e between,the preferred fa,ctors used to
,,,,,
model producti,vity bet,"ween, for instance,",regions,or harvesting m,ethods. This
,,,,,
could potentiall,y explai,n the variability of p,roductivit,"y models and if,","for example,"

some factors ar,e more s,uitable to explain p,roductivit,y for FT machin,es compared
