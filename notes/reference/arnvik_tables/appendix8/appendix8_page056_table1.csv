commonly us,ed to rapid,ly collect large,amounts of data,". However,",this does not
,,,,,
appear to be,the case.,A possible reas,on for this coul,d be that se,veral of the
,,,,,
identified pub,lications s,tudied machines,on work eleme,nt level. Sin,ce follow-up
,,,,,
data from OB,Cs cannot,easily distingui,sh between wor,"k elements,",these studies
,,,,,
would not hav,e been pos,sible to conduct,with follow-up,data.,
,,,,,
The number o,f operator,s studied in publ,ications varied c,onsiderably,. While most
,,,,,
studies focuse,d on a sing,"le operator, the n",umber of operat,ors included,ranged from
,,,,,
1 to 120. How,"ever, mor",e than a third of,publications did,not provide,information
,,,,,
on the numbe,r of operat,"ors studied, or it c",ould not be asce,rtained. Add,"itionally, the"
,,,,,
experience le,vel of op,erators varied w,"idely, with so",me research,ers studying
,,,,,
operators with,only a few,months of expe,"rience, while oth",ers focused,on those with

several decad,es of exper,ience.,,,
,,,,,
A wide range,of unique,variables were i,ncorporated in,"models, yet",a clear trend
,,,,,
could be obse,"rved, i.e.",the vast majority,of researchers,incorporated,tree size in
,,,,,
models. Tren,ds across r,egions and harv,esting methods,were also ob,"served, with"
,,,,,
some being,more pro,minent than oth,ers. For exam,"ple, in Nort",h American
,,,,,
"publications,",as well as,those utilizing,"FT-harvesting,",it was more,common to
,,,,,
incorporate “,Cycle bas,ed” and “Move,ment/distance”,independent,variables in
,,,,,
models. Addi,"tionally, it",was more comm,on to model pr,oductivity a,s work cycle

element level,studies.,,,,

The type of,mathem,atical function,used to descr,ibe product,ivity varied
,,,,,
"considerably,",and most,researchers used,a linear functio,n to model,productivity.
,,,,,
"However, not",able region,al trends were ev,ident in this reg,ard as well.,"For example,"
,,,,,
a higher prop,ortion of p,ublications from,"Asia, Eastern Eu","rope, and N",orth America
,,,,,
developed pur,ely linear,models.,,,
,,,,,
Regarding del,ays in pro,"ductivity models,",most models ex,cluded dela,"ys. However,"
,,,,,
when delays,were incl,"uded, various ap",proaches were,observed. S,ome models
,,,,,
included all r,ecorded d,"elays, while othe",rs used a delay,"factor of 1,","2, and some"
,,,,,
included dela,ys shorter t,han 15 minutes.,"In a few cases, i",t was unclea,r whether the
