From the findings,of this revi,"ew, it appe",ars that only,a limited,number of
,,,,,
productivity models,for fully m,echanized h,arvesting have,been dev,eloped and
,,,,,
published using foll,ow-up data i,n the period,2013-2023. Th,is would in,dicate that
,,,,,
researchers seem to,have favored,manual data,collection whe,n studying,harvesting
,,,,,
machines. Neverthel,"ess, several",of the identifi,ed models deve,loped from,follow-up
,,,,,
data showed promi,sing results,in terms of,predictive cap,abilities.,Due to the
,,,,,
beneficial aspects of,follow-up st,"udies, such a",s lower cost (e.,g. Olivera,et al. 2016;
,,,,,
Brewer et al. 2018;,Liski et al.,"2020), alon",g with the evid,ently relat,ively good
,,,,,
predictive power,of identified,"models, th",ese results m,ay facilita,te further
,,,,,
development of mo,dels with foll,ow-up data.,"In addition, du",e to the rel,atively low
,,,,,
cost and good predi,ctive capabi,"lities, compa",nies that keep,records of,production
,,,,,
data would likely be,interested i,n this method,of developing,and enhan,cing future
,,,,,
models (Eriksson &,Lindroos 20,14).,,,

Regression analysis,is a commo,n statistical,method to anal,yze factors,’ effect on
,,,,,
productivity (Acuna,et al. 2012),". It is, howev","er, important t",o note that,traditional
,,,,,
"statistical methods,",such as linea,r regression a,"nalysis, may n",ot perform,adequately
,,,,,
for very large amou,nts of data (,Rossit et al.,"2019). This, in",combinatio,n with the
,,,,,
vast amounts of da,ta collected,with sensor,s and OBCs fr,om harves,"ters, could"
,,,,,
potentially limit the,possibility,to analyze f,ollow-up data,with only,traditional
,,,,,
methods. The traditi,onal statistic,al methods m,ay not take full,advantage,of the data.
,,,,,
"Researchers, such a",s Rossit et a,"l. (2019), ha",ve therefore uti,lized ”Big,Data” and
,,,,,
data mining techni,ques to addr,ess these li,mitations. The,results on,modelling
,,,,,
productivity and ana,lysis of diffe,rent variable,s’ effect on prod,uctivity wi,th decision
,,,,,
trees and k-means a,lgorithms w,ere promisin,"g, probably faci",litating fur,ther use of
,,,,,
these approaches i,n combinati,on with aut,omatic data co,llection w,ith OBCs.
,,,,,
"Additionally, due to",the already,large amoun,ts of data colle,cted from,"OBCs, and"
,,,,,
the anticipated deve,lopments in t,echnology w,hich would like,ly further i,ncrease the
,,,,,
available data amou,nt (Gao et al,". 2022), wou",ld make machin,e learning,techniques
,,,,,
a prominent method,for analyzin,g large volu,mes of data (Li,ski et al. 2,020). Liski
,,,,,
et al. (2020) pred,icted harves,ter producti,vity with Ord,inary Lea,st Squares
,,,,,
"regression (OLS), G",radient boos,ted machine,"(GBM), and Su",pport vect,or machine
,,,,,
(SVM). OLS prove,d to be a suff,icient metho,"d, however, GB",M and SV,M showed
,,,,,
great potential for fu,ture research,.,,,
,,,,,
There are certain va,riables that,OBCs do not,"capture, such a",s slope (Ol,ivera et al.
,,,,,
2016). Since slope,could poten,tially affect,productivity an,d be incor,porated in
,,,,,
"models, which was",done by Eri,ksson & Lin,"droos (2014), W",illiams &,Ackerman
,,,,,
"(2016), Ackerman e","t al. (2018),",and Norihiro,"et al. (2018), i",t would be,beneficial
,,,,,
to collect informatio,n regarding,slope when,harvesting is pe,rformed in,areas with
,,,,,
steep slopes. Oliver,a et al. (20,16) conducte,d a follow-up,study on,a harvester
