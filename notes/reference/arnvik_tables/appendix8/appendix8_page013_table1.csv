able to perform al,l the steps in the,cut-to-length met,hod. Felling he,ads lack this
,,,,
processing capabil,"ity, thus they opera",te according to th,e full-tree harve,sting method
,,,,
(Anon 2023c). Ad,"ditionally, both h",ead types can be,equipped with,accumulator
,,,,
"arms, which enabl",es the heads to a,ccumulate multip,le trees in the,head in one
,,,,
cutting work cycle,before processing,or bunching (An,on 2023c). Thi,"s can, in turn,"
,,,,
increase productiv,ity as the time,spent per tree,can be substa,ntially lower
,,,,
(Johansson & Gull,berg 2002).,,,
,,,,
When it comes to,the base machine,"s used, there are",some distinct,categories in
,,,,
terms of whether o,r not it is purpose-,"built for forestry,",and whether it,is wheeled or
,,,,
tracked (Figure 1).,Even though har,vesting machines,might share si,milar features
,,,,
"across categories,",there are notable,differences bet,ween them tha,t can impact
,,,,
productivity. For e,"xample, Ackerm",an et al. (2018) st,udied a tracke,d Volvo EC-
,,,,
210-BF excavator,and a tracked Tim,berPro TL-725B,harvester in th,inning. Even
,,,,
though the machin,es were relatively,similar in appeara,"nce, the Timber",Pro harvester
,,,,
was specifically t,ailored to forest,"ry, whereas the",Volvo excava,tor was not.
,,,,
"Consequently, the",two machines ex,hibited different p,roductivities w,hen working
,,,,
in varying terrain.,Ackerman et al. (,2018) concluded t,hat for every 1,% increase in
"slope, the producti",vity of the excava,tor-based harveste,r decreased by,0.048 m3 per
,,,,
productive machin,"e hour, while the p",urpose-built harve,ster’s producti,vity remained
,,,,
constant. Ackerma,n et al. (2018) not,ed that the dispari,ty in productiv,ity was likely
,,,,
due to the purpose-,built harvester’s s,elf-levelling and s,tabilizing capab,"ilities, which"
,,,,
were absent in t,he excavator-bas,ed machine. Fur,"thermore, the",mobility of
,,,,
excavator-based h,arvesters is consi,dered to be infer,ior to that of,purpose-built
,,,,
harvesters. This,may pose challen,ges when travers,ing in forests,with bigger
,,,,
"obstacles, such as",stones and stumps,(Bergroth et al. 2,006).,
,,,,
It is essential to n,ote the difference,between conven,tional harveste,rs and feller-
,,,,
bunchers to harw,arders (Figure 1,). Harwarders ar,e similar to,purpose-built
,,,,
harvesters and swi,ng-boom feller-bu,"nchers, however,",a fundamental,difference is
,,,,
the harwarders’ ca,pability to both cu,t and forward logs,"/trees, which is",possible due
,,,,
to load carriers (Jo,nsson et al. 2023),". Yet, when only",harvesting is c,"oncerned, the"
,,,,
difference in produ,ctivity is minimal,compared to conv,entional harves,ters (Jonsson
,,,,
2021).,,,,
