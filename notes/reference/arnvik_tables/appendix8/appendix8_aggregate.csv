12,1,1. Intro,duction,,,,
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,The majority of,global roundwo,od harves,t is carrie,d out with the ful,ly mechanized
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,cut-to-length (C,TL) and full-tree,(FT) me,thods (Lu,ndbäck et al. 202,"1). In CTL, the"
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,"trees are felled,","delimbed, and b",ucked in,the forest,"stand, whereas i","n FT, the trees"
12,1,are only felled.,Approximately,1.38 bill,ion m3 of,roundwood wa,s harvested in
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,"2016, and it was",reported that fu,lly mech,anized CT,L and FT consti,tuted 37% and
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,"33%, respectivel",y (Lundbäck et,al. 2021).,"However,",the utilization of,the harvesting
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,methods differe,d greatly depen,ding on t,he country,". For example, i",n Sweden and
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,"Finland, almost",all harvesting is,carried o,ut with the,fully mechanize,d CTL method
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,"while, for exa","mple, in the U",nited Sta,"tes, 70%",is carried out,with the fully
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,mechanized FT,method (Lundbä,ck et al.,2021).,,
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,Numerous mach,ine types and m,odels ar,e applied,in fully mechani,zed harvesting
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,and the choice,of machine can,affect wo,rk produc,tivity. Different,machines will
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,yield different,productivities u,nder var,ious work,conditions (e.g,. Eriksson &
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,Lindroos 2014;,Ackerman et al,. 2018).,Conseque,"ntly, it is essenti",al to correctly
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,choose the mo,st suitable mac,hine and,accuratel,y predict its pr,oductivity for
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,efficient plannin,"g, control, and c",ost mana,gement. T,his can be achiev,ed by applying
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,precise producti,vity models (Lin,droos &,Cavalli 20,16).,
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,1.1 CTL a,nd FT-mac,hinery,,,
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,Several types of,machines can be,utilized,in fully me,chanized harvest,ing. Machines
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,commonly used,"are harvesters,",feller-bu,"nchers, a",nd harwarders (F,igure 1). The
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,machines are si,milar in their co,nstruction,", sharing",common design,elements. One
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,of the most prom,inent features is,a crane (t,he so-call,"ed swing-boom),",which enables
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,the machines to,reach several tr,ees from,the same,position. Howev,"er, the ”drive-"
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,to-tree” feller-b,uncher type is no,t equipp,ed with a c,rane (Figure 1).,"Consequently,"
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,this type of mac,hine drives up to,each tree,and cuts it,(Anon 2023b; d),". Furthermore,"
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,to actually cut t,"he tree, some ki",nd of fell,ing device,"is required, and",these devices
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,are often called,heads. These can,broadly,be catego,rized into two typ,es: processing
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,heads and fellin,g heads. In add,ition to a,"bar saw,",processing head,s are equipped
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,with delimbing,knives and feed,rollers. T,hese feaut,ures enable the h,ead to fell the
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,"tree, delimb it,",and buck it into,multiple,logs (proc,"essing), which m",eans that it is
12,1,,,,,,
12,1,,,,12,,
13,1,able to perform al,l the steps in the,cut-to-length met,hod. Felling he,ads lack this
13,1,,,,,
13,1,processing capabil,"ity, thus they opera",te according to th,e full-tree harve,sting method
13,1,,,,,
13,1,(Anon 2023c). Ad,"ditionally, both h",ead types can be,equipped with,accumulator
13,1,,,,,
13,1,"arms, which enabl",es the heads to a,ccumulate multip,le trees in the,head in one
13,1,,,,,
13,1,cutting work cycle,before processing,or bunching (An,on 2023c). Thi,"s can, in turn,"
13,1,,,,,
13,1,increase productiv,ity as the time,spent per tree,can be substa,ntially lower
13,1,,,,,
13,1,(Johansson & Gull,berg 2002).,,,
13,1,,,,,
13,1,When it comes to,the base machine,"s used, there are",some distinct,categories in
13,1,,,,,
13,1,terms of whether o,r not it is purpose-,"built for forestry,",and whether it,is wheeled or
13,1,,,,,
13,1,tracked (Figure 1).,Even though har,vesting machines,might share si,milar features
13,1,,,,,
13,1,"across categories,",there are notable,differences bet,ween them tha,t can impact
13,1,,,,,
13,1,productivity. For e,"xample, Ackerm",an et al. (2018) st,udied a tracke,d Volvo EC-
13,1,,,,,
13,1,210-BF excavator,and a tracked Tim,berPro TL-725B,harvester in th,inning. Even
13,1,,,,,
13,1,though the machin,es were relatively,similar in appeara,"nce, the Timber",Pro harvester
13,1,,,,,
13,1,was specifically t,ailored to forest,"ry, whereas the",Volvo excava,tor was not.
13,1,,,,,
13,1,"Consequently, the",two machines ex,hibited different p,roductivities w,hen working
13,1,,,,,
13,1,in varying terrain.,Ackerman et al. (,2018) concluded t,hat for every 1,% increase in
13,1,"slope, the producti",vity of the excava,tor-based harveste,r decreased by,0.048 m3 per
13,1,,,,,
13,1,productive machin,"e hour, while the p",urpose-built harve,ster’s producti,vity remained
13,1,,,,,
13,1,constant. Ackerma,n et al. (2018) not,ed that the dispari,ty in productiv,ity was likely
13,1,,,,,
13,1,due to the purpose-,built harvester’s s,elf-levelling and s,tabilizing capab,"ilities, which"
13,1,,,,,
13,1,were absent in t,he excavator-bas,ed machine. Fur,"thermore, the",mobility of
13,1,,,,,
13,1,excavator-based h,arvesters is consi,dered to be infer,ior to that of,purpose-built
13,1,,,,,
13,1,harvesters. This,may pose challen,ges when travers,ing in forests,with bigger
13,1,,,,,
13,1,"obstacles, such as",stones and stumps,(Bergroth et al. 2,006).,
13,1,,,,,
13,1,It is essential to n,ote the difference,between conven,tional harveste,rs and feller-
13,1,,,,,
13,1,bunchers to harw,arders (Figure 1,). Harwarders ar,e similar to,purpose-built
13,1,,,,,
13,1,harvesters and swi,ng-boom feller-bu,"nchers, however,",a fundamental,difference is
13,1,,,,,
13,1,the harwarders’ ca,pability to both cu,t and forward logs,"/trees, which is",possible due
13,1,,,,,
13,1,to load carriers (Jo,nsson et al. 2023),". Yet, when only",harvesting is c,"oncerned, the"
13,1,,,,,
13,1,difference in produ,ctivity is minimal,compared to conv,entional harves,ters (Jonsson
13,1,,,,,
13,1,2021).,,,,

14,1,,,,,
14,1,Productivity models a,re used to p,redict harvesting ma,chines’ product,ivity and the
14,1,,,,,
14,1,development of these,models has,been carried out for,many decades (,Brewer et al.
14,1,,,,,
14,1,"2018). In this review,",the terms p,roductivity (output/i,nput) and time,consumption
14,1,,,,,
14,1,(input/output) are use,d interchan,"geably. Therefore, “",productivity” r,efers to both
14,1,,,,,
14,1,aspects.,,,,
14,1,,,,,
14,1,Productivity models,serve many,purposes. For exam,"ple, accurate p",redictions of
14,1,,,,,
14,1,productivity are requi,red to effect,ively deliver the cor,rect volume of,timber at the
14,1,,,,,
14,1,correct time and at a,reasonable p,rice (Eriksson & Li,ndroos 2014; L,indroos et al.
15,1,2024). Addi,"tionally, models c",an be used to,determine s,"alaries, pa","yments, and"
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,calculate cos,ts of harvesting (N,uutinen et al. 20,08). Models,can also b,e utilized for
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,evaluation of,new machines an,d entire new sys,tems (Liski e,t al. 2020,). In addition
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,"to this, oper",ators can be evalua,"ted, and compa",risons can b,e conducte,d to explore
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,the effect of,age and training on,productivity (M,alinen et al.,2018). Sim,"ilarly, stand"
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,and terrain,parameters’ effect,on productivit,y can be stu,died by a,nalyzing the
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,relationship,between these and,productivity wi,th models (V,isser & Sp,inelli 2012).
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,To develop,productivity mode,"ls, data is nee",ded which i,s usually,collected by
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,performing,studies dedicated f,or this purpos,e (e.g. Erikss,on & Lin,droos 2014;
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,Bergström et,"al. 2016, 2022)",,,,
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,1.3 Wor,"k studies, tim","e studies,",and follo,w-up s,tudies
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,The purpose,of a work study is t,o determine the,relationship b,etween in,put variables
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,and output v,"ariables, while als",o assessing the,influence of,other vari,ables on the
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,relationship,(Acuna et al. 2012),. Work studies,in forestry h,ave been c,onducted for
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,more than,a century and the,ir primary obj,ective in fo,rest work,", improving"
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,operational e,"ffectiveness, have",been largely unc,hanged since,they origi,nated (Koŝir
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,et al. 2015).,"However, Koŝir et",al. (2015) also,emphasized,that the sc,ope of work
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,studies has w,"idened, and site im",pact assessmen,t are often in,cluded tod,ay.
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,In forest re,"search, work stud",ies can typical,ly be catego,rized into,two types:
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,comparative,studies and correl,ation studies. I,n comparativ,"e studies,",comparisons
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,are made b,"etween, for insta","nce, two or m",ore method,s or mac,hines. Other
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,influencing,"factors, such as w","ork conditions,",remain the,same. In,"comparison,"
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,correlation s,tudies assess the,relationship bet,ween produ,ctivity and,changes in
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,influential fa,"ctors, such as tree",size (Lindroos,2010). Con,ducting ti,me studies is
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,one common,way to study the,relationship be,tween produ,ctivity and,influencing
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,factors (Björ,heden et al. 1995).,,,,
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,A time stud,y aims to study th,e relationship b,etween inpu,ts and out,puts under a
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,relatively bri,ef period (Eriksso,n & Lindroos 2,014). It is th,e predomi,nant method
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,for assessing,work time in fores,t operations (S,zewczyk & S,owa 2017,). Depending
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,on the detai,l desired in the ti,"me study, the o",utput variabl,e can be,measured in
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,different lev,"els, i.e. having d",ifferent observ,ational units,. Producti,vity can be
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,evaluated on,"plot, shift, work","cycle, or wor",k element le,vel. Whe,n evaluating
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,productivity,"on plot level, the",time needed to,harvest the e,ntire plot,and the total
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,outcome is n,oted. For shift lev,"el, the time and",output for t,he entire s,hift is noted.
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,When more,detailed results,"are desired, re",searchers m,ay study,a machine’s
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,performance,on work cycle or,work element l,evel. A work,cycle is c,omprised of
15,1,,,,,,
15,1,several repet,itive work elemen,ts (Acuna et al.,2012). This,can be ill,ustrated with
15,1,,,,,,

18,1,,,,,,,
18,1,widely used re,gress,ion metho,d is ordinary l,east square (OLS,) (Ac,una et al. 2012).
18,1,,,,,,,

18,1,"However, whe",n thi,s is not the,"case, OLS’s a",bility to accurate,ly pre,dict outcome is

18,1,limited (Liski,et al.,2020). If,several colline,ar variables are i,nclud,"ed in the model,"

19,1,,,,,,
19,1,larger and at a c,ertain point th,e productiv,ity will decrea,se. This is due t,o the extra
19,1,,,,,,
19,1,time it will take,to handle larg,er trees (Vi,sser & Spinelli,2012). Furtherm,"ore, there"
19,1,,,,,,
19,1,are other factor,s that have be,en found to,have an impa,ct on productivi,ty such as

20,1,with at least 1,6 years,of experience had,the highe,"st productivity,",while older
20,1,,,,,,

44,1,,,,,,
44,1,number of studies,on harvesting p,roductivity t,hat were,conducted be,tween 2013
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,and 2023. In co,"mparison, Lindr",oos’ and C,avalli’s,(2016) and,Böhm’s and
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,Kanzian’s (2023) r,eviews of cable y,arding produ,ctivity c,onsisted of 21,publications

44,1,,,,,,
44,1,Cavalli’s (2016) sy,stematic review,was more exh,austive,and comprehe,nsive as they
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,covered more data,bases. This furth,er highlights,the abun,dance of work,studies that
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,have been conduct,ed for the type o,f machinery,covered,in this review,", since there"
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,is a possibility tha,t publications th,at contained,models,but were only,available in

44,1,,,,,,
44,1,Lindroos & Cava,lli (2016) observ,ed that their,compil,ation of publi,cations was
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,rather patchy in ter,ms of geographi,c location of s,tudies.,This observatio,n holds true
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,to some extent fo,r this review as,well. While t,his revi,ew contained,publications
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,from more countri,"es, an unproporti",onal number,of publi,cations origina,ted from the
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,same few countrie,s. This could be,the result of,several,reasons. The,terminology
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,used in the search,might have been,somewhat bi,ased an,d the chosen s,earch strings
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,could have favore,d the terminolog,y used in th,ese coun,tries. Howeve,"r, it is more"
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,plausible that mo,re studies simpl,y are being,conduct,ed and publis,hed in these
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,countries.,,,,,
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,"Interestingly, only",a very limited n,umber of pu,blicatio,ns were follow,-up studies.
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,This is somewhat,surprising since,the possibilit,y for su,ch studies has,been around
44,1,,,,,,
44,1,"for a decade, and",the several bene,fits compare,d to tim,e studies coul,d have been
45,1,expected to promo,te a wider use of,them. For exam,"ple, time",studies,are usually
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,relatively expensiv,e and time-consu,ming to conduct c,ompared t,o follo,w-up studies
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,(e.g. Olivera et al.,2016; Brewer et a,l. 2018; Liski et,al. 2020).,Howev,"er, there are"
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,also certain negat,ive aspects to f,ollow-up studies,which c,ould o,utweigh the
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,positives and expl,ain why research,ers might be he,sitant to c,onduc,t them. The
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,"dataset can, for ins","tance, be of lowe",r detail (Eriksson,& Lindro,os 20,14). Another
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,important limitatio,n might be that f,ollow-up data fro,m regular,opera,tions require
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,that the data owne,r (e.g. a forest co,mpany) allows th,e use and,publi,cation of the
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,"data. Further, the a",bsence of direct o,bservations in the,field or by,came,ra also limits
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,the ability to captu,re different work,elements’ time. S,ince a su,bstanti,al number of
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,publications were,conducted as wor,k element level s,"tudies, th",ese mi,ght not have
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,been possible to pe,rform with follo,w-up data and is,likely the,reason,for the low
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,number of follow-,up studies. Moreo,"ver, follow-up st",udies are,almost,exclusive to
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,CTL-machinery w,ith sensors and,processing head,s. A subs,tantial,number of
45,1,,,,,,

45,1,,,,,,
45,1,follow-up studies.,"However, the ratio",of time studies to,follow-u,p studi,"es, and CTL-"

45,1,,,,,,
45,1,where studyboards,with stopwatches,were the most p,rominent.,Anoth,er difference
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,is the use of video,"cameras, where t",hey appeared mo,re frequen,tly in t,his review’s
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,"results. However, i",t is also importan,t to note the abse,nce of inf,ormati,on regarding
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,equipment types,in this review.,Thirty-three pu,blications,did,not provide
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,information on eq,"uipment type, an",d this lack of inf,ormation,could,significantly
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,affect the results.,"Furthermore, sim",ilarly to Koŝir e,t al. (201,"5), a",bias towards
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,European publicati,ons was induced,"in this study, ye",t some dif,ferenc,es were still
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,observed. For exa,"mple, in African,","Northern, South","ern, and",Weste,rn European
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,"regions, it was m",ore common to,use Handheld-co,mputers,compa,red to other

45,1,4.2 Model c,haracteristic,s,,,
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,The most common,independent va,riable in models,was piece,"size,",which is no
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,surprise given the,well-known rela,tionship of piece,size and,produ,ctivity (e.g.
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,Visser & Spinelli 2,012; Eriksson &,Lindroos 2014; O,livera et a,l. 201,6; Ackerman
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,"et al. 2018). Yet,",there was a lar,ge variation in,which oth,er va,riables were
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,incorporated in m,"odels. However,",it should be em,phasized,that se,veral of the
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,publications exami,ned were not stri,ctly productivity,studies. F,or exa,"mple, Santos"
45,1,,,,,,
45,1,et al. (2020) incorp,orated engine spe,ed in revolutions/,min and h,ydrauli,c pump flow
46,1,in liters/min to model,tim,e consumption for,"moving, felling, pr","ocessing, and"
46,1,,,,,

46,1,,,,,
46,1,between these variabl,"es,",and the models,did yield good c,oefficients of
46,1,,,,,
46,1,determination. However,", the",y may not be typica,l or the most effecti,ve when trying
46,1,,,,,
46,1,to predict productivity,in,harvesting operati,ons under various,environmental
46,1,,,,,
46,1,conditions. Nevertheles,"s, it",exemplifies the var,ious aims for produ,"ctivity models,"
46,1,,,,,
46,1,and that it is reasonab,le t,hat several publica,tions’ models were,comprised of
46,1,,,,,
46,1,“unconventional” variab,les.,,,
46,1,,,,,
46,1,While several trends co,uld,be observed in term,s of incorporation o,f independent
46,1,,,,,
46,1,variables in models usin,g th,e arbitrary categorie,"s, some were more p",rominent than
46,1,,,,,
46,1,"others. For example,",in,North American,"publications, 76.5%",and 70.6%
46,1,,,,,
46,1,incorporated “Work cyc,le-b,ased” and “Moveme,nt/distances travelle,d” variables in
46,1,,,,,
46,1,"models, respectively. Th","is, c",ombined with the f,act that 82.4% of all,publications in
46,1,,,,,
46,1,North American public,atio,ns predicted work,"cycle time, suggests",that in North
46,1,,,,,
46,1,"America, particularly",in,"The United States,",it is more comm,on to model
46,1,,,,,
46,1,productivity as work c,ycle,"times, incorporatin","g these variables, r","ather than, for"
46,1,,,,,
46,1,"example, output/time, w",hich,was more common,in other regions. Ad,"ditionally, the"
46,1,,,,,
46,1,“Work cycle-based” an,d “,Movement/distance,s travelled” variabl,es were more
46,1,,,,,
46,1,common in FT-machin,es’,"models, which wer",e also more commo,nly studied in
46,1,,,,,
46,1,North American public,atio,"ns. However, the",proportion of FT-m,achine studies
46,1,,,,,
46,1,incorporating these vari,able,s (25.0% and 38.9%,", respectively) is n",ot proportional
46,1,,,,,
46,1,to the higher percentage,of,North American pub,lications featuring t,"hese variables,"
46,1,,,,,
46,1,further suggesting that t,hese,variables are more,commonly used in N,orth America.
46,1,,,,,
46,1,"Additionally, in North A",me,"rican publications, e",lement level studies,were the most
46,1,,,,,
46,1,"frequent, which was sim",ilar,"to other regions, ex",cept South America,. Even though
46,1,,,,,
46,1,element level studies we,re c,"onducted, researche",rs in these publicatio,ns still decided
46,1,,,,,
46,1,to model productivity as,wo,rk cycle time.,,
46,1,,,,,
46,1,It is crucial to consider,the,purposes of the ide,"ntified publications,",as these could
46,1,,,,,
46,1,influence the choice of,ind,ependent variables,". For example, Böh",m & Kanzian
46,1,,,,,
46,1,(2023) identified sever,al p,urposes within pub,lications with mode,ls. While this
46,1,,,,,
46,1,review did not consider,the,purposes of the ide,"ntified publications,",many differed
46,1,,,,,
46,1,in their primary purpos,e w,hich could have inf,luenced the incorpor,ated variables
46,1,,,,,
46,1,and the observed trends.,For,"example, it was mo",re common to incorp,orate variables
46,1,,,,,
46,1,regarding weight in sou,ther,n Europe compared,to other regions. Th,is could be the
46,1,,,,,
46,1,consequence of the fact,that,the majority (78%),of publications in so,uthern Europe
46,1,,,,,
46,1,focused on short-rotati,on,"forestry, coppice h","arvesting, or bioma","ss harvesting,"
46,1,,,,,
46,1,where weight might be,eas,ier and more appro,"priate to measure, c",onsidering the
46,1,,,,,
46,1,purposes of the publi,catio,"ns. Additionally,",in 66.7% of south,ern European
46,1,,,,,
46,1,"publications, productivi",ty w,as modelled in weig,"ht/time, which furth",er explains the
47,1,high proporti,on of sout,hern European,publicatio,ns including we,ight related
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,variables.,,,,,
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,When it comes,to the mod,els’ predictive c,"apabilities,",the identified mo,dels spanned
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,from explaini,ng almost,nothing (0.7%),to almost,all (99.0%) of t,he observed
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,variation. In,"fact, numer",ous publication,s’ models,exhibited excep,tionally low
47,1,coefficients o,f determina,tion (R2 and R,2-adjusted),. Lindroos & Ca,valli (2016)
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,stressed the irr,elevance of,such models du,e to low pre,dictive capabiliti,"es. However,"
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,as mentioned,"previously,",the main aim of,several p,ublications in this,review was
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,not necessaril,y to develop,models with hi,gh predicti,"ve powers, but r",ather explore
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,the effects of,various fac,tors. Consequen,"tly, it is re",asonable that se,veral models
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,exhibited low,predictive,capabilities.,Reporting,models with lo,w statistical
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,significance a,nd low co,efficients of de,terminatio,n could still off,er insightful
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,contributions.,For exam,"ple, if no stati",stical sign,ificance exists b,etween two
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,"variables, it m",ight simply,indicate the ab,sence of re,lationship betwe,"en them, and"
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,the purpose of,the publica,tion might be to,display tha,t lack of relations,hip. Another
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,reason is that i,t might sho,w that further st,udies are n,eeded in that spec,ific research
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,area. Lahrsen,et al. (202,2) highlighted t,hat two st,udies contradicte,d each other
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,regarding the i,mpact of sn,"ow, and hence t",he importa,nce of further res,earch in that
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,area.,,,,,
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,For the identif,ied product,"ivity models, it",was more,common to repo,rt R2 values
47,1,instead of R2-,adjusted val,ues. This is sim,ilar to the,results of Lindro,os & Cavalli
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,(2016) and B,öhm & Ka,nzian (2023).,Adding mo,re predictors wi,ll inevitably
47,1,increase R2 an,d can result,in an overfitted,model. H,"owever, R2-adjust",ed penalizes
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,"this, and provi",des a more r,obust evaluation,of the mo,dels’ actual ability,to represent
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,the proportion,of variance,(Böhm & Kanz,ian 2023).,"Thus, an overfitte",d model will
47,1,not accurately,predict out,"come and it is, t","herefore, pr",eferable to repor,t R2-adjusted
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,for regression,models wit,h multiple predi,ctors.,,
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,There was a w,ide variatio,n of what was re,ported in te,rms of statistical,significance.
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,In several pu,"blications,",no statistical s,ignificance,at all was rep,orted. Some
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,publications o,nly reporte,d statistical sig,nificance o,f the predictors,and not the
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,"actual model,",while a few,publications vali,dated their,models with data,sets reserved
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,for this purpos,e. Validatin,g a model with,a reserved,dataset is more r,"obust, as it is"
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,not the data th,e model has,been trained on,(Raschka,"2018). Thus, it is",preferable to
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,test the predict,ive capabili,ties of a model t,his way. Ho,"wever, manual da",ta collection
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,is relatively ex,pensive an,d time-consumin,g (e.g. Oli,vera et al. 2016;,Brewer et al.
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,2018; Liski et,al. 2020).,"Consequently, r",esearchers,might be relucta,nt to collect
47,1,,,,,,
47,1,larger datasets,", or, at least,",be reluctant to s,et aside a p,art of an already s,mall number
47,1,,,,,,

48,1,,,,,,,

48,1,,,,,,,
48,1,information o,n statistic,al significa,"nce, rend",ering the m,odels un,suitable for
48,1,,,,,,,
48,1,predictions in,practice.,"Moreover, i",t is essen,tial to use p,roductivit,y models in

48,1,appropriate w,ork conditi,ons. If a mo,del is app,lied in condi,tions for,which it was
48,1,,,,,,,

48,1,,,,,,,
48,1,ensure that th,e work con,ditions are,similar to,those from w,hich the,models were

48,1,,,,,,,

49,1,,,,,,
49,1,The number of oper,ators used in p,ublications,and their e,xperience,varied widely.
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,The human factor in,forest operatio,n has been s,tudied wid,ely and is k,nown to affect
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,productivity (e.g. Pu,rfürst & Erler,2011; Hägg,ström & L,indroos 20,16; Malinen et
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,al. 2018). To negat,"e this factor,",a large sam,ple of oper,ators wou,ld be required
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,(Bergstrand 1987).,To study a lar,ge quantity,of operato,rs in a sin,gle time study
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,would be unfeasible,. It would be to,o time-cons,"uming and,","therefore,",too expensive.
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,The majority of tim,e studies in th,is review s,tudied one,or a few o,perators. This
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,could be somewhat,limiting due t,o the individ,ual and int,er-individ,ual differences
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,in productivity. In th,e study by Pur,fürst & Erle,"r (2011), a",difference i,n productivity
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,of a factor of 1.8 for,experienced o,perators was,observed a,nd the hum,"an factor was,"

49,1,even though the stan,d characteristi,cs are very s,"imilar, the r",esulting pr,oductivity and

49,1,,,,,,
49,1,term data collected,automatically,could be us,ed (Strandg,ard et al. 2,013). Spinelli

49,1,the largest number o,f operators cle,arly stated to,be used fo,r developin,g productivity
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,models observed in,this review.,"However, e",ven thoug,h no actua,l number was

49,1,"harvesters, most of",which can be,expected to,have been,operated b,y at least two
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,"operators. Hence, t",hese types of,follow-up,studies ut,ilizing lar,ge number of
49,1,,,,,,

49,1,4.5 Delays,,,,,
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,"In total, 379 models",predicted pro,ductivity or,time consu,mption ex,cluding delays
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,and 39 models incl,uded delays. D,elays may o,ccur errati,"cally, and t",he occurrence
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,of delays differ depe,nding on work,conditions,and machin,e types. In,a shorter time
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,"study, it can, therefo","re, be difficult",to precisely,determine,the extent,of delays with
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,certainty and the ap,plicability of t,hese delay ti,mes to oth,er studies.,"Consequently,"
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,instead of including,the actual del,ays observe,d in a stud,"y, factors",may instead be
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,implemented that h,ave been devel,oped from,several lon,ger time st,udies (Spinelli
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,& Visser 2008). Eig,ht models in t,his review h,ad such fac,tors instea,d of the actual
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,delays observed in t,he studies due,to the relati,vely short,period the,machines were
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,"studied. Moreover,",in four model,"s, whether",the depend,ent variab,le included or
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,excluded delay time,could not be d,educed wit,h complete,certainty. I,t could simply
49,1,,,,,,
49,1,be that the author of,this review co,uld not dedu,ce it. How,"ever, if this",is not the case
50,1,and the publicati,on did not ac,tually exp,licitly provide inform,ation on whether they
50,1,,,,,
50,1,included delays,or not is prob,lematic if,the model were to be,applied in harvesting.
50,1,,,,,
50,1,Even if a publica,tion has prov,ided clear,information that the,"model included delays,"
50,1,,,,,
50,1,there is still a p,ossibility th,at the mod,el might not accurat,ely predict the actual
50,1,,,,,
50,1,outcome due to t,he erratic na,ture of del,ays. Spinelli & Visse,r (2008) conducted 34
50,1,,,,,
50,1,studies and dela,ys constitute,"d, on aver","age, 28.9% of the tot",al scheduled machine
50,1,,,,,
50,1,time. This sugg,ests that dela,ys can co,nstitute a relatively b,ig portion of the total
50,1,,,,,
50,1,scheduled time.,Delays shou,ld thus be,incorporated into mo,"dels with caution, and"
50,1,,,,,
50,1,the data of delay,s should be,based on l,ong-term studies (Sp,inelli & Visser 2008).
50,1,,,,,
50,1,"Fortunately, it a",ppears that re,searchers,prefer to omit delays,from models and only
50,1,,,,,
50,1,include producti,ve time sinc,e the majo,rity of models (89.5,%) were structured in
50,1,,,,,
50,1,this manner. Thi,s is similar t,o the resul,ts of Lindroos & Cav,alli (2016) and Böhm
50,1,,,,,
50,1,& Kanzian (202,3).,,,
50,1,,,,,

50,1,,,,,
50,1,future,reviews,,,
50,1,,,,,
50,1,Some weakness,es can be fou,nd in this,review that could hav,"e been improved and,"
50,1,,,,,
50,1,"ultimately, have",given better,and mor,e comprehensive res,ults. Even though this
50,1,,,,,
50,1,study covered a,relatively v,oluminous,"dataset, more public",ations could probably
50,1,,,,,
50,1,have been ident,ified. A wid,er range,of databases could h,ave been searched to
50,1,,,,,
50,1,identify publicat,ions. Snowb,alling tech,niques could also ha,"ve been used, in terms"
50,1,,,,,
50,1,of using the ref,erence lists f,rom identi,fied publications to,track down additional
50,1,,,,,
50,1,ones. Furthermo,"re, the time",interval f,or publications consi,dered eligible for this
50,1,,,,,
50,1,review could ha,ve been exte,nded to in,clude more publicati,ons. More data could
50,1,,,,,
50,1,possibly have alt,ered the outc,ome to so,"me extent. However,",given the large number
50,1,,,,,
50,1,of publications,already inclu,ded in thi,"s review, it is uncer",tain how significantly
50,1,,,,,
50,1,these additional,publications,would hav,e affected the results,.
50,1,,,,,
50,1,Another limitati,on is the choi,ce of searc,h strings applied in d,atabases. More search
50,1,,,,,
50,1,strings could ha,ve been adde,d througho,ut the study such as,"“on-board-computer”,"
50,1,,,,,
50,1,"“OBC”, and ot",her similar,strings to,favor follow-up st,"udies. Likewise, it is"
50,1,,,,,
50,1,somewhat uncle,ar whether t,he search s,trings had a propens,ity for time studies. It
50,1,,,,,
50,1,was uncertain i,f more publ,ications t,hat used follow-up,data could have been
50,1,,,,,
50,1,identified with m,ore compre,hensive se,"arch strings, since on",ly a limited number of
50,1,,,,,
50,1,publications of t,hat sort were,identified,.,
50,1,,,,,
50,1,The decision to r,efine the sea,rch results,in Web of Science w,ith the filter “forestry”
50,1,,,,,
50,1,is somewhat que,stionable. Lo,"gically, al",l studies eligible for t,his review should have
50,1,,,,,
50,1,been in this re,"search area,","however,",this might not be,"the case. Thus, the"
50,1,,,,,
50,1,exhaustiveness,of this revie,w is unce,"rtain. However, give",n the relatively large
51,1,"dataset, the number of",publications,and models in,this revi,ew shou,ld likely suffice
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,to draw conclusions re,garding produ,ctivity model,s and tre,nds in th,e literature.
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,If the review were to be,conducted ag,"ain, or if a sim",ilar revi,ew were,to be conducted
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,for other types of m,"achinery, so",me aspects s,hould b,e chang,ed to improve
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,"reproducibility, transpa","rency, and to",ascertain exh,austivene,ss. The,aforementioned
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,points should obviou,sly be consi,"dered, which",would,make th,e review more
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,exhaustive and compre,hensive. Furt,"her, it would",be prefer,able if t,he review was a
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,systematic literature re,view (SLR).,This review c,annot be,classifi,ed as a SLR as
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,several parts of the met,hodology for,SLRs were o,mitted. In,this rev,"iew, some parts"
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,of the SALSA framew,ork were not,as detailed as,they are,in SLRs,(Mengist et al.
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,2020). One aspect of t,he SALSA fr,amework that,could h,ave bee,n more detailed
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,was the inclusion criter,"ia, particularl",y inclusion cri,terion 5:,The pub,lication focuses
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,on forest operations an,d pertains to,"harvesters, fel",ler-bunc,"hers, or",harwarders and
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,could possibly contain,productivity,models. This,criterion,could b,e interpreted as
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,somewhat broad and s,"ubjective, rel",ying on the a,uthor's o,wn inter,pretation of the
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,likelihood that the publ,ications inclu,ded productiv,ity mode,"ls, based",on the title and
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,abstract of the publicat,ion. Consequ,"ently, a bias w",as possib,ly induc,ed which could
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,have affected the outc,ome. It wou,"ld, therefore,",be bene,ficial fo,r future similar
51,1,,,,,,
51,1,reviews to more prec,isely define,this type of i,nclusion,criterio,n to make the
51,1,,,,,,

51,1,,,,,,
51,1,Meta-analysis could b,e performed i,f a similar re,view wer,e to be,conducted. In a
