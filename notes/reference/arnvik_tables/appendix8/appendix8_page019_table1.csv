1.5 Produ,ctivity-infl,uencing,factors,,
,,,,,
A multitude of,factors affec,t productiv,ity to a vary,ing degree for,harvesting
,,,,,
machines. The,most importan,t factor is t,he size of the,tree being handl,ed (the so
,,,,,
called “piece siz,"e”, normally d",escribed by,"stem volume,","mass, or diamet",er at breast
,,,,,
height) (e.g. Vi,sser & Spinell,i 2012; La,hrsen et al. 202,2; Schmiedel et,al. 2022).
,,,,,
Productivity wil,l increase as tr,ee size incr,"eases, a relatio",nship called the,“piece size
,,,,,
"law”. However,",the level of in,crease in pr,oductivity is re,duced as tree siz,e becomes
,,,,,
larger and at a c,ertain point th,e productiv,ity will decrea,se. This is due t,o the extra
,,,,,
time it will take,to handle larg,er trees (Vi,sser & Spinelli,2012). Furtherm,"ore, there"
,,,,,
are other factor,s that have be,en found to,have an impa,ct on productivi,ty such as
,,,,,
slope (e.g. Eriks,son & Lindro,os 2014; A,ckerman et al.,"2018), harveste",d trees per
,,,,,
hectare (e.g. Ber,gström & Di,Fulvio 2014,; Eriksson & L,"indroos 2014), tr",ee species
,,,,,
(e.g. Kizha & H,an 2016; Este,ban et al. 2,018; Liski et al,". 2020), and ope",rator skills
,,,,,
and experience,(e.g. Lindroos,2010; Purf,ürst & Erler 20,11; Malinen et a,l. 2018).
,,,,,
A factor that h,as commonl,y been dis,"regarded, yet",has been found,to affect
,,,,,
productivity pro,"foundly, is th",e human fa,ctor (e.g. Lindr,oos 2010; Purfü,rst & Erler
,,,,,
2011; Häggströ,m & Lindroos,2016). Pur,fürst & Erler (,2011) studied th,e effect of
,,,,,
human influenc,e on producti,vity in har,vester operatio,ns and mentione,d that the

performance of,operators vari,ed between,operators and,can fluctuate ov,er time for
