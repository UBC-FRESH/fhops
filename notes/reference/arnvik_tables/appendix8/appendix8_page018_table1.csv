When the data,has b,een collec,"ted, regression",analysis is often,the me,thodology used
,,,,,,
when develop,ing,models. I,n regression,"analysis, the rel",ations,hip between a
,,,,,,
dependent vari,able,and one or,multiple indep,endent variables,is dep,icted. The most
,,,,,,
widely used re,gress,ion metho,d is ordinary l,east square (OLS,) (Ac,una et al. 2012).
,,,,,,
"In OLS, it is",also,common t,hat dummy v,ariables are utili,zed in,the models to
,,,,,,
incorporate di,screte,"factors, s",uch as type of,machine. OLS w,orks,well when there
,,,,,,
is a limited n,umbe,r of indep,endent variab,"les, and the rela",tionsh,ip between the
,,,,,,
independent,variab,les and,the dependen,t variable is a,pprox,imately linear.
,,,,,,
"However, whe",n thi,s is not the,"case, OLS’s a",bility to accurate,ly pre,dict outcome is
,,,,,,
limited (Liski,et al.,2020). If,several colline,ar variables are i,nclud,"ed in the model,"
,,,,,,
it will be over,fitted,and not a,ccurately pred,ict outcome (Co,sta et,al. 2012). This
will lead to an,incre,ase of the,model’s R2 val,"ue, which repres",ents t,he proportion of
,,,,,,
variance expla,ined,by the ind,ependent varia,ble(s) (Böhm &,Kanzi,an 2023). When
,,,,,,
several indepe,ndent,variables,are incorporat,"ed into a model,",it is m,ore appropriate
to report the,R2-adj,usted valu,"e, as it accou",nts for the additi,onal,variables. Since
more variables,will,always in,crease the R2 v,"alue, the adjuste",d R2,provides a more
,,,,,,
accurate reflec,tion,of the mo,del’s true pred,ictive capability,(Lind,roos & Cavalli
,,,,,,
2016). Despite,"this,",Lindroos,and Cavalli (20,16) found that so,me re,"searchers, when"
modelling pro,ducti,"vity, only",reported their,models’ R2 va,"lue, e",ven though the
