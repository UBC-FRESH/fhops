Stand descriptions were also,documente,d in terms of,noting tree specie,"s, stand age,"
,,,,
mean values and value range,s of diamete,r at breast h,eight and stem vol,ume. If stem
,,,,
volume was not explicitly m,entioned in,the publicat,"ion, it was disrega",rded even if
,,,,
it could be inferred. Howev,"er, tree wei",ght or biom,ass was noted if,available as
,,,,
supplementary data if stem,volume w,as absent.,"Moreover, groun","d condition,"
,,,,
"ground roughness, and slop",e were repo,rted. If a pu,blication did not,use a terrain
,,,,
"classification system, the",authors’ ow,n descripti,on of the stand,was noted.
,,,,
"Additionally, the number of",operators an,d their expe,rience were docu,mented.
,,,,
Key information regarding t,he models,and assessm,ent of models we,re extracted.
,,,,
"Observational unit, i.e. shift,","plot, cycle,",or element l,evel of time studie,s was noted.
,,,,
The number of observatio,ns used to,develop t,he models were,also noted.
,,,,
"Furthermore, the models we",re extracted,", and their",goodness of fit st,atistics were
documented in the form of,coefficients,of determin,ation (R2 and R2-,adjusted) as
,,,,
well as the statistical signific,ance of the,models (F-v,alue and P-value),.
,,,,
2.3 Analysis,,,,
,,,,
Descriptive analyses of th,e extracted,data were,"conducted, and r",egional and
,,,,
harvesting method-based d,ifferences w,ere analyze,d regarding equi,"pment type,"
,,,,
"observational unit, mode",ls’ indepe,ndent and,dependent var,"iables, and"
,,,,
mathematical structure. Add,"itionally, an",arbitrary cat,egorization of the,independent
,,,,
variables was applied and,is provided,in Append,ix 9. The categor,ies include:
,,,,
Movement/distances trave,lled; Weig,ht of ha,ndled unit and,/or output
,,,,
(trees/stems/logs/biomass);,Diameter/D,BH of harve,sted trees/stems/lo,gs; Machine
,,,,
data; Height of harvested tre,es; Harvesti,ng intensity/,density; Miscella,neous; Work
,,,,
cycle-based observations;,Miscellaneo,us features,of harvested tree,s; Operator
,,,,
features; Terrain and work c,onditions; T,reatment/ex,ecution of harvest,; Volume of
,,,,
handled unit and/or output (t,ree/stem/log,). Furtherm,"ore, for the analys",es regarding
,,,,
"regional variations, Europe",was divide,d into Nort,"hern, Southern, W","estern, and"
,,,,
"Eastern Europe, according to",the United,Nations geo,scheme (Appendi,x 3).
