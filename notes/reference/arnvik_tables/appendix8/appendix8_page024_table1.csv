Criteria,Criteria definition,,,,
,,,,,
Inclusion 1,The publication is a,scientific article o,r conference pape,r,
,,,,,
Inclusion 2,The publication is in,English,,,
,,,,,
Inclusion 3,The publication is pu,blished between,2013 and 2023,,
,,,,,
Inclusion 4,The publication is ac,cessible for stud,ents and employe,es at,the Swedish
,,,,,
,University of Agricu,ltural Sciences,,,
,,,,,
Inclusion 5,The publication focu,ses on forest op,erations and perta,ins to,"harvesters,"
,,,,,
,"feller-bunchers, or h",arwarders and c,ould possibly con,tain,productivity
,,,,,
,models,,,,
,,,,,
Inclusion 6,The publication incl,udes models that,predict productiv,"ity, t",ime of input
,,,,,
,"per unit, time per wo",rk cycle or work,element,,

2.2 Data,extraction,,,,
,,,,,
From the pub,lications that met t,he inclusion cr,"iteria, several ty",pes,of data were
,,,,,
extracted to E,xcel. The extracted,data included,the author(s) of,the,"publications,"
,,,,,
geographic inf,ormation (continen,"t and country),",harvesting metho,"d, m","achine type,"
,,,,,
and model. Th,e work elements c,onstituting a w,ork cycle will di,ffer,substantially
,,,,,
depending on,harvesting method.,"Therefore, the",machines were c,ateg,orized based
,,,,,
on this. For,"CTL-machines, th",ey were furthe,r categorized a,s ha,rvester and
,,,,,
harwarder. Ha,rvesters were then,divided into pu,rpose-built and,exca,"vator-based,"
,,,,,
depending on,if the machines we,re specifically,tailored to fores,try.,"Lastly, these"
,,,,,
machines wer,e categorized as w,heeled or trac,ked. Furthermor,"e, m",achines that
,,,,,
performed FT,-harvesting were f,irst categorized,as feller-bunch,er o,r harwarder.
,,,,,
"Secondly, fell",er-bunchers were,subcategorized,as swing-boom,or,drive-to-tree
,,,,,
variants. Thes,e were subsequentl,y categorized as,purpose-built or,exc,avator-based
,,,,,
depending on,if the machines we,re specifically,designed for for,estry,". Lastly, the"
,,,,,
machines wer,e categorized as tra,cked or wheeled,(Figure 2).,,
