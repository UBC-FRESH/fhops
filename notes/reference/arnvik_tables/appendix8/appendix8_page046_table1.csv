productivity. The main,aim,of Santos et al. (20,20) was to study th,e relationships

between these variabl,"es,",and the models,did yield good c,oefficients of

to predict productivity,in,harvesting operati,ons under various,environmental

While several trends co,uld,be observed in term,s of incorporation o,f independent

variables in models usin,g th,e arbitrary categorie,"s, some were more p",rominent than
,,,,
"others. For example,",in,North American,"publications, 76.5%",and 70.6%
,,,,
incorporated “Work cyc,le-b,ased” and “Moveme,nt/distances travelle,d” variables in
,,,,
"models, respectively. Th","is, c",ombined with the f,act that 82.4% of all,publications in
,,,,
North American public,atio,ns predicted work,"cycle time, suggests",that in North
,,,,
"America, particularly",in,"The United States,",it is more comm,on to model
,,,,
productivity as work c,ycle,"times, incorporatin","g these variables, r","ather than, for"
,,,,
"example, output/time, w",hich,was more common,in other regions. Ad,"ditionally, the"
,,,,
“Work cycle-based” an,d “,Movement/distance,s travelled” variabl,es were more
,,,,
common in FT-machin,es’,"models, which wer",e also more commo,nly studied in
,,,,
North American public,atio,"ns. However, the",proportion of FT-m,achine studies
,,,,
incorporating these vari,able,s (25.0% and 38.9%,", respectively) is n",ot proportional
,,,,
to the higher percentage,of,North American pub,lications featuring t,"hese variables,"
,,,,
further suggesting that t,hese,variables are more,commonly used in N,orth America.
,,,,
"Additionally, in North A",me,"rican publications, e",lement level studies,were the most

"frequent, which was sim",ilar,"to other regions, ex",cept South America,. Even though
,,,,
element level studies we,re c,"onducted, researche",rs in these publicatio,ns still decided

It is crucial to consider,the,purposes of the ide,"ntified publications,",as these could

(2023) identified sever,al p,urposes within pub,lications with mode,ls. While this
,,,,
review did not consider,the,purposes of the ide,"ntified publications,",many differed
,,,,
in their primary purpos,e w,hich could have inf,luenced the incorpor,ated variables
,,,,
and the observed trends.,For,"example, it was mo",re common to incorp,orate variables
,,,,
regarding weight in sou,ther,n Europe compared,to other regions. Th,is could be the
,,,,
consequence of the fact,that,the majority (78%),of publications in so,uthern Europe
,,,,
focused on short-rotati,on,"forestry, coppice h","arvesting, or bioma","ss harvesting,"

where weight might be,eas,ier and more appro,"priate to measure, c",onsidering the
