"In summary, 115",publications wit,h 422 mode,ls for p,roductivity for,"harvesters,"
,,,,,
"feller-bunchers, a",nd harwarders,were identif,ied. Th,is clearly sh,ows that a
,,,,,
substantial numbe,r of publications,were publish,ed each,year regardin,g machines’

performances. Ad,"ditionally, it mu",st be noted t,hat seve,ral publicatio,ns related to
,,,,,
harvesting produ,ctivity were om,itted from,the re,view since t,hese lacked
,,,,,
mathematical mod,"els. In those, the",productivity,or time c,onsumption w,"as recorded,"
,,,,,
but no regression,model was dev,eloped. This,further,emphasizes t,he extensive
,,,,,
number of studies,on harvesting p,roductivity t,hat were,conducted be,tween 2013
,,,,,
and 2023. In co,"mparison, Lindr",oos’ and C,avalli’s,(2016) and,Böhm’s and
,,,,,
Kanzian’s (2023) r,eviews of cable y,arding produ,ctivity c,onsisted of 21,publications
,,,,,
"with 82 models, a",nd 70 publicatio,ns with 98,"models,",respectively.,Lindroos’ &
,,,,,
Cavalli’s (2016) sy,stematic review,was more exh,austive,and comprehe,nsive as they
,,,,,
covered more data,bases. This furth,er highlights,the abun,dance of work,studies that
,,,,,
have been conduct,ed for the type o,f machinery,covered,in this review,", since there"
,,,,,
is a possibility tha,t publications th,at contained,models,but were only,available in

other databases ha,ve inadvertently,been missed.,,,
,,,,,
Lindroos & Cava,lli (2016) observ,ed that their,compil,ation of publi,cations was
,,,,,
rather patchy in ter,ms of geographi,c location of s,tudies.,This observatio,n holds true
,,,,,
to some extent fo,r this review as,well. While t,his revi,ew contained,publications
,,,,,
from more countri,"es, an unproporti",onal number,of publi,cations origina,ted from the
,,,,,
same few countrie,s. This could be,the result of,several,reasons. The,terminology
,,,,,
used in the search,might have been,somewhat bi,ased an,d the chosen s,earch strings
,,,,,
could have favore,d the terminolog,y used in th,ese coun,tries. Howeve,"r, it is more"
,,,,,
plausible that mo,re studies simpl,y are being,conduct,ed and publis,hed in these
,,,,,
countries.,,,,,
,,,,,
"Interestingly, only",a very limited n,umber of pu,blicatio,ns were follow,-up studies.
,,,,,
This is somewhat,surprising since,the possibilit,y for su,ch studies has,been around
