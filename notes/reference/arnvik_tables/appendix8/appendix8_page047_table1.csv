When it comes,to the mod,els’ predictive c,"apabilities,",the identified mo,dels spanned
,,,,,
from explaini,ng almost,nothing (0.7%),to almost,all (99.0%) of t,he observed
,,,,,
variation. In,"fact, numer",ous publication,s’ models,exhibited excep,tionally low
coefficients o,f determina,tion (R2 and R,2-adjusted),. Lindroos & Ca,valli (2016)
,,,,,
stressed the irr,elevance of,such models du,e to low pre,dictive capabiliti,"es. However,"
,,,,,
as mentioned,"previously,",the main aim of,several p,ublications in this,review was
,,,,,
not necessaril,y to develop,models with hi,gh predicti,"ve powers, but r",ather explore
,,,,,
the effects of,various fac,tors. Consequen,"tly, it is re",asonable that se,veral models
,,,,,
exhibited low,predictive,capabilities.,Reporting,models with lo,w statistical
,,,,,
significance a,nd low co,efficients of de,terminatio,n could still off,er insightful
,,,,,
contributions.,For exam,"ple, if no stati",stical sign,ificance exists b,etween two
,,,,,
"variables, it m",ight simply,indicate the ab,sence of re,lationship betwe,"en them, and"
,,,,,
the purpose of,the publica,tion might be to,display tha,t lack of relations,hip. Another
,,,,,
reason is that i,t might sho,w that further st,udies are n,eeded in that spec,ific research
,,,,,
area. Lahrsen,et al. (202,2) highlighted t,hat two st,udies contradicte,d each other
,,,,,
regarding the i,mpact of sn,"ow, and hence t",he importa,nce of further res,earch in that

For the identif,ied product,"ivity models, it",was more,common to repo,rt R2 values
instead of R2-,adjusted val,ues. This is sim,ilar to the,results of Lindro,os & Cavalli
,,,,,
(2016) and B,öhm & Ka,nzian (2023).,Adding mo,re predictors wi,ll inevitably
increase R2 an,d can result,in an overfitted,model. H,"owever, R2-adjust",ed penalizes
,,,,,
"this, and provi",des a more r,obust evaluation,of the mo,dels’ actual ability,to represent
,,,,,
the proportion,of variance,(Böhm & Kanz,ian 2023).,"Thus, an overfitte",d model will
not accurately,predict out,"come and it is, t","herefore, pr",eferable to repor,t R2-adjusted
,,,,,
for regression,models wit,h multiple predi,ctors.,,
,,,,,
There was a w,ide variatio,n of what was re,ported in te,rms of statistical,significance.
,,,,,
In several pu,"blications,",no statistical s,ignificance,at all was rep,orted. Some
,,,,,
publications o,nly reporte,d statistical sig,nificance o,f the predictors,and not the
,,,,,
"actual model,",while a few,publications vali,dated their,models with data,sets reserved
,,,,,
for this purpos,e. Validatin,g a model with,a reserved,dataset is more r,"obust, as it is"
,,,,,
not the data th,e model has,been trained on,(Raschka,"2018). Thus, it is",preferable to
,,,,,
test the predict,ive capabili,ties of a model t,his way. Ho,"wever, manual da",ta collection
,,,,,
is relatively ex,pensive an,d time-consumin,g (e.g. Oli,vera et al. 2016;,Brewer et al.
,,,,,
2018; Liski et,al. 2020).,"Consequently, r",esearchers,might be relucta,nt to collect
,,,,,
larger datasets,", or, at least,",be reluctant to s,et aside a p,art of an already s,mall number
,,,,,
of data points,for data v,alidation. This,would be a,possible explan,ation for the
,,,,,
absence of val,idation data,in studies. Furt,"her, as pre",viously mentione,"d, the nature"
