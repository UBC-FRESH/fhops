,,,,,
The majority of,global roundwo,od harves,t is carrie,d out with the ful,ly mechanized
,,,,,
cut-to-length (C,TL) and full-tree,(FT) me,thods (Lu,ndbäck et al. 202,"1). In CTL, the"
,,,,,
"trees are felled,","delimbed, and b",ucked in,the forest,"stand, whereas i","n FT, the trees"
are only felled.,Approximately,1.38 bill,ion m3 of,roundwood wa,s harvested in
,,,,,
"2016, and it was",reported that fu,lly mech,anized CT,L and FT consti,tuted 37% and
,,,,,
"33%, respectivel",y (Lundbäck et,al. 2021).,"However,",the utilization of,the harvesting
,,,,,
methods differe,d greatly depen,ding on t,he country,". For example, i",n Sweden and
,,,,,
"Finland, almost",all harvesting is,carried o,ut with the,fully mechanize,d CTL method
,,,,,
"while, for exa","mple, in the U",nited Sta,"tes, 70%",is carried out,with the fully
,,,,,
mechanized FT,method (Lundbä,ck et al.,2021).,,
,,,,,
Numerous mach,ine types and m,odels ar,e applied,in fully mechani,zed harvesting
,,,,,
and the choice,of machine can,affect wo,rk produc,tivity. Different,machines will
,,,,,
yield different,productivities u,nder var,ious work,conditions (e.g,. Eriksson &
,,,,,
Lindroos 2014;,Ackerman et al,. 2018).,Conseque,"ntly, it is essenti",al to correctly
,,,,,
choose the mo,st suitable mac,hine and,accuratel,y predict its pr,oductivity for
,,,,,
efficient plannin,"g, control, and c",ost mana,gement. T,his can be achiev,ed by applying
,,,,,
precise producti,vity models (Lin,droos &,Cavalli 20,16).,

Several types of,machines can be,utilized,in fully me,chanized harvest,ing. Machines
,,,,,
commonly used,"are harvesters,",feller-bu,"nchers, a",nd harwarders (F,igure 1). The
,,,,,
machines are si,milar in their co,nstruction,", sharing",common design,elements. One
,,,,,
of the most prom,inent features is,a crane (t,he so-call,"ed swing-boom),",which enables
,,,,,
the machines to,reach several tr,ees from,the same,position. Howev,"er, the ”drive-"
,,,,,
to-tree” feller-b,uncher type is no,t equipp,ed with a c,rane (Figure 1).,"Consequently,"
,,,,,
this type of mac,hine drives up to,each tree,and cuts it,(Anon 2023b; d),". Furthermore,"
,,,,,
to actually cut t,"he tree, some ki",nd of fell,ing device,"is required, and",these devices
,,,,,
are often called,heads. These can,broadly,be catego,rized into two typ,es: processing
,,,,,
heads and fellin,g heads. In add,ition to a,"bar saw,",processing head,s are equipped
,,,,,
with delimbing,knives and feed,rollers. T,hese feaut,ures enable the h,ead to fell the
,,,,,
"tree, delimb it,",and buck it into,multiple,logs (proc,"essing), which m",eans that it is
