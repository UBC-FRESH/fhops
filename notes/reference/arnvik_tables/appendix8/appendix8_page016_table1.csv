the publication,by Bergströ,m et al. (2022,"), where t",hey studied a,Valmet 901.4
,,,,,
harvester’s prod,uctivity in bo,om-corridor t,hinning. Th,e harvester’s w,ork cycle was
,,,,,
comprised of se,ven unique re,petitive work,"elements, m",any of which,were executed
,,,,,
"for every tree, e",xcluding mis,cellaneous ele,ments and,delays.,
,,,,,
Several types o,f equipment,can be used t,o measure,time in work,studies. In the
,,,,,
survey of the ro,le of work st,udies by Koŝi,r et al. (201,"5), handheld",computers and
,,,,,
mechanical stu,dy boards wi,th stopwatch,es were the,most comm,"on equipment,"
,,,,,
while video rec,"ordings, data","loggers, com",pany recor,"ds, or combina",tions of these
,,,,,
were less comm,on. Moreove,"r, while sever",al types of e,quipment can,"be used, there"
,,,,,
is limited know,ledge regardi,ng what equi,pment type,is most com,monly used to
,,,,,
measure time f,or modelling,purposes. Th,"ere is, how","ever, literature",that describe
,,,,,
what the most,common type,s are for wor,k studies (K,oŝir et al. 20,"15). However,"
,,,,,
since the surve,y by Koŝir et a,l. (2015) was,"conducted,",nearly a deca,"de has passed,"
,,,,,
and changes in,equipment p,references mi,ght have oc,curred. Addit,"ionally, a bias"
,,,,,
towards Europe,an researcher,s was exhibit,ed in the st,udy caused by,", for instance,"
,,,,,
personal conn,ections. Furt,"hermore, the",Hawthorn,e effect sug,gests a great
,,,,,
probability that,a worker will,change their,behavior wh,en aware of b,eing observed.
,,,,,
This change in,behavior can,significantly,skew the re,sults in a shor,ter time study
,,,,,
(Acuna et al. 2,012). The eq,uipment type,can therefo,re be connect,ed to different
,,,,,
levels of bias-ri,sk.,,,,
,,,,,
Koŝir et al. (20,15) pointed o,ut the signific,ance of the,technological,advancements
,,,,,
of machines an,"d sensors, wh",ich facilitates,monitoring,work for lon,ger periods of
,,,,,
time by utilizin,g sensors inste,ad of manual,collection o,f data. Additio,"nally, modern"
,,,,,
harvesters are,equipped w,ith sophistica,ted on-boa,rd computers,(OBC) that
,,,,,
automatically c,apture produ,ction data (B,rewer et a,l. 2018). For,"instance, if a"
,,,,,
harvester is equ,ipped with an,adequate OB,"C, each harv",ested log’s dia,"meter, length,"
,,,,,
and assortment,are collected,along with ot,her product,ion data. In so,me regions of
,,,,,
"the world, such",data has be,en collected f,or several,decades from,regular forest
,,,,,
operations (Ke,mmerer & Lab,elle 2021).,,,
,,,,,
The data is coll,ected from O,BCs’ with sta,ndards suc,h as StanFord,(Brewer et al.
,,,,,
2018). The Sta,nFord report i,s an extensib,le markup l,anguage (XM,"L) file, which"
,,,,,
allows easy ext,raction and a,nalysis of dat,a in a struc,tured manner,(Kemmerer &
,,,,,
Labelle 2021).,The introduc,tion of autom,atic data c,ollection has,facilitated the
,,,,,
analysis of mac,hines’ produc,tivity with fo,llow-up stu,dies (Brewer e,"t al. 2018), as"
,,,,,
it is possible to,use existing,data collected,from regu,lar production,activities. An
,,,,,
example of a,publication t,hat utilized a,n extensiv,e amount of,automatically
,,,,,
collected data i,s by Eriksson,and Lindroos,"(2014), wh",o used data c,reated by over
700 harvesters,that harvested,more than 2,0 million m,3 of roundwo,od to develop
