dependent,variables were,cat,egorized into ten,categories. For producti,"vity models,"
,,,,,
there were,three depende,nt v,ariables: volume,"/time (PV), weight/tim","e (PW), and"
,,,,,
units/time,(PU). For ti,me,consumption mo,"dels, there were three",dependent
,,,,,
variables:,time/volume (,TV),", time/weight (T","W), and time/unit (TU).",There were
,,,,,
four depen,dent variables f,or ti,me consumption,irrespective of output: ti,me per work
,,,,,
cycle (W),", time per wor",k e,lement(s) regard,ing handling of trees (,"E), time for"
,,,,,
moving (M,"), and time fo",r lo,ading (L). Produc,tivity as volume/time (,PV) was the
,,,,,
dependent,variable most,freq,uently modelled,(Table 9) and multiple,publications
,,,,,
featured s,everal of the,men,tioned dependen,t variable types. More,"over, seven"
,,,,,
models we,re developed f,or b,oth purpose-built,and excavator-based ha,"rvesters, and"
,,,,,
one model,was developed,for,both a purpose-b,uilt swing-boom feller-,buncher and
,,,,,
an excavat,or-based drive,-to-t,ree feller-bunche,"r. Therefore, the numbe",r of models

in Table 7,"is 430, instead",of 4,22.,,
