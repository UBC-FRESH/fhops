Discrepancies betwe,en autom,atic and m,anual measurem,ents of diam,eter at breast

observed that diamet,er at brea,st height a,nd volume valu,es measured,by harvester

heads were significa,ntly lowe,r than thos,e obtained by m,anual measu,rements with

diameter at breast he,ight tape,. In their st,"udy, they cond",ucted a conv,entional time

study to develop pro,ductivity,models a,nd compared th,ese to mode,ls developed

using consecutive tim,estamps,from follo,w-up data. Nota,"bly, they onl",y used values

from the manual me,asuremen,ts of diam,eter at breast he,ight and vol,ume for both

models likely would,vary as,well if har,vester head me,asurements,were used in

remains uncertain as,Brewer e,t al. (2018),did not examin,e this. Theref,"ore, in future"
