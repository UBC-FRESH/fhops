Corvallis, USA

ABSTRACT
A production study of a single-grip harvester
and forwarder was conducted in a second-growth
thinning operation in western Oregon, USA. Production levels for the harvester exceeded 30 m 3 /
PMH (productive machine hour, delay-free). There
was no significant difference in harvester production between stands marked prior to logging and
those in which the trees were selected by the operator. Production levels for the forwarder ranged from
10.2 m3 to 14.5 mVPMH. When landing space was
limited, a two-pass forwarding technique (separate
loads of sawlogs and pulpwood) was more productive than a single-pass technique (products mixed on
each load and sorted at the landing). Regression
equations were developed to predict harvester production per PMH on the basis of tree dbh and to
predict forwarder production per PMH on the basis
of product type, volume per load, and travel distance. Thinning cost for this cut-to-length system
wasUS$12.49/m 3 [US$35.37/cunit],excludinghauling and a profit-and-risk allowance.
Keywords: mechanized logging, single-grip harvester,

INTRODUCTION
Harvesting activities are rapidly shifting from
old-growth to second-growth stands in the Pacific
Northwest region of the USA. Approximately 60%
of the commercial timberland in western Oregon
could be operable for various types of in-woods
mechanized equipment [5]. Of this operable timberland, about 58% of the sawtimber stands and about
64% of the poletimber stands are on slopes of less

than 35%. Information is lacking, however, on the
productivity and environmental effects of certain
machines, such as multi-function harvesters and
forwarders, working in partial cutting operations
with small timber (dbh < 30 cm [12 in.]) on such
medium slopes (20-40%) [12].
Mechanized logging provides end products of
more consistent and higher quality, smaller crew
sizes, and a safer work environment than does conventional logging [10]. Some ground-based harvesting equipment, however, may not be suitable for the
large tree sizes and broken and steep terrain in parts
of the Pacific Northwest. But where ground-based
machinery is suitable and results in minimal environmental impacts, harvesting economics and logistics may favour it over cable systems.
Various logging methods, from those with small
skyline yarders to ground-based cut-to-length systems, can be used for thinnings in the Pacific Northwest. Cut-to-length systems are operations in which
all of the processing (delimbing and bucking) occurs
in the woods. These systems are derived from
modern Nordic harvesting technology and offer a
wide range of alternatives for thinnings and clearcuts
[8]. Cut-to-length systems are different from conventional logging systems in that less labour, road
construction, and landing areas are needed. They
also produce end products of higher quality and
more consistent dimension than do conventional
systems, and they also allow for lower costs for
woodyard management [1]. Furthermore, several
states have recognized the safer work environment
these systems provide and now offer lower worker's
compensation rates for them than for conventional
logging [7].
Cut-to-length systems are generally comprised
of two machines, a harvester (single-grip or doublegrip) and a forwarder. The harvester fells and processes trees in the direction of its path, and the
forwarder transports cut-to-length logs to roadside.
Both machines travel over a mat of limbs and tops,
which potentially reduce soil compaction and erosion. The distribution of limbs and tops throughout
the stand may also be more aesthetically pleasing
and beneficial for nutrient recycling than would a
residue pile at a landing.
Harvester productivity may be highly variable,
depending on individual tree size, operator skill and
motivation, branch size, numbers of unmerchantable

and merchantable trees per unit area, slope and
ground conditions, and undergrowth density [13,
17]. A compilation of results from several similar
harvesting studies [12] shows that harvester productivity generally is closely related to tree size.
Baumgras [3] found that the cost per tree decreases
rapidly as tree size increases and that the effect on
productivity of equipment moves between trees and
of the number of trees harvested per move is more
pronounced in thinnings or when small trees are
harvested than in clearcuts and harvests of larger
trees. In another study [14], the number of
unmerchantable trees in a harvest area had the greatest influence on productive time. Total product
length has also been found to greatly influence the
number of trees harvested per productive machine
hour [20].
A Swedish study of 35 medium-sized forwarders showed that primary transportation of sawlogs
was faster than that of pulpwood and that primary
transportation in clearcuts was faster than in partial
cuts [11]. The average mechanical availability of the
35 forwarders was 93% and utilization was 84%.
Productivity averaged 10.3 m3 per gross effective
hour. Other forwarder studies have reported production rates of 9.6 m 3 per operating hour [19] and
12.7 tonnes per productive machine hour [16] for
average forwarding distances of 170 m and 658 m,
respectively.
Steep slopes may pose difficulties to harvester
and forwarder operations, because these machines
must generally travel straight up and down a slope
to maintain stability [17]. Equipment operators must
spend extra time manoeuvring the machines in undulating terrain. When the operator faces downhill,
the view of the harvester head may become blocked
by the wheels of the chassis. Small trees and
underbrush also affect visibility and may cause downtime by damaging the chain, bar, or hydraulic hoses
[17]. High capital costs have also been noted as a
disadvantage of harvesters and forwarders [15].
This study was conducted to provide basic information on production and cost for a cut-to-length
system applied by a logging contractor in thinnings
in the Pacific Northwest. The objectives of the study
were to detail harvester and forwarder production
and cost, to develop regression equations to predict
productivity on the basis of stand and operating
conditions, and to determine overall thinning economics for these systems. Further objectives were to

compare time elements for harvesters in premarked
stands and in stands where the operators selected
the trees and for two different forwarding techniques. Research on soil compaction [2] and stand
damage [4] was also conducted but is not reported
here.
METHODS
The study was located approximately 11 km
south of Lyons, Oregon, in the Cascade Mountains.
The operation consisted of thinning a 47-year-old
Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) stand with a Timberjack
2518 harvester (equipped with a Koehring Wa terous
762 head) and an FMG 910 forwarder. The entire
thinning area was approximately 40.5 ha [100 acres];
two harvester/forwarder systems were operating
there. Only one of these systems was studied, and
only on a portion of the thinning area—the forwarder on 5.7 ha [14 acres] and the harvester on
0.90 ha [2.2 acres]. The harvester operator had approximately 18 months of experience in similar terrain, while the forwarder operator had approximately 9 months of experience. The products produced by the operation were sawlogs (5.4 m [17 ft
10 in.] long, to a 15.2-cm [6-in.] top) and pulpwood
(6.1m [20 ft] long, to a 5.1-cm [2-in.] top).
Harvester
The study area for the harvester was broken
down into two treatment areas: one in which the
trees to be left were marked by a forester and one in
which they were unmarked and selected by the
harvester operator. Each stand consisted of 3
equipment trails with similar terrain and length.
Each tree in the study area was measured for diameter at breast height (dbh) and successively numbered prior to the beginning of the study. The
difference between the average values for dbh in the
two stands prior to thinning was not statistically
significant (P<0.05). Average stand conditions before
and after harvesting are shown in Table 1. The
average slope was 15° (26%) for the marked stand
and 17° (31%) for the unmarked stand.
A detailed time study was conducted on the
harvester. All activities associated with harvesting
each tree were considered collectively as one sample
and were broken out into basic time elements (Table
2). The data were recorded with a special program,
called SIWORK3 [6], and run on a Husky Hunter 2

computer [9]. The SIWORK3 program records time
elements to the centi-minute and allows the user to
enter other numerical data such as tree number. The
data were downloaded to a personal computer, imported into a spreadsheet program, and used for
analysis. A simple linear regression equation was
developed to predict productivity [m3 per productive machine hour, delay-free (PMH)] on the basis of
tree dbh.
Forwarder
Average site conditions on the study area for the
forwarder before and after thinning are shown in
Table 3. Within the study area, 2 methods of
forwarder operation were evaluated: (1) a two-pass
technique that involved sorting in the woods and
forwarding only one product type (pulpwood or
sawlogs) in a load, and (2) a single-pass technique
that involved forwarding both product types mixed
in a load and sorting at the landing. The study area
was not separated into 2 distinct stands (one for each
method of forwarding operation) because the
forwarder operator preferred to remain flexible about
the products needed for trucking. Therefore, both

methods were used throughout the stand; the goal
was to obtain a representative sample for each method
of operation. Ground slope for the study area ranged
from 0 to 23° (0 to 42%). The north side of the area
was bounded by a creek, the south side by steeper
slopes (19 to 22° [35 to 40%]), and the east side by a
previously thinned area. A flat bench ran east-west
through the middle of the study area. Trails were
flagged by an equipment operator before the harvester operation began (Figure 1); trail spacing was
approximately 15 to 18 m [50 to 60 ft].
A detailed time study was conducted on the
forwarder. All activities associated with forwarding
one load were considered one sample and were
broken out into basic time elements (Table 4). Timestudy data on the forwarder were also collected by
using the SIWORK3 program and analysed in a
spreadsheet. In addition, a map of the equipment
trails was used to detail the actual path of the forwarder during each cycle (Figure 1). This information was used to determine forwarding distances, as
well as the number of machine passes on the trails for
a soil compaction study [2].

RESULTS
Harvester Productivity and Cost
The harvester was studied for approximately 12
hours in the marked and unmarked stands. The
average time per tree to harvest was slightly less in
the marked than in the unmarked stand, and the
harvester processed more trees per PMH in the
marked stand (Table 5). There were no treatmentspecific delays; because the duration of the study
was relatively short, all of the delays were averaged
and a time was allocated to each individual tree
harvested for calculating machine availability and
utilization. Availability and utilization are therefore
slightly lower for the marked than for the unmarked
stand because of the differing cycle times per tree.
However, availability and utilization would be expected to be the same for both stands. Most of the
delays (43.9%) were for personal reasons, such as
lunch and miscellaneous breaks. Repairs accounted
for a substantial portion (34.6%) of the delay time.

The most common repair delay consisted of chain
and bar replacement, which averaged 6.90 minutes.
The rest of the delay time consisted of miscellaneous
operational delays, such as cutting away large stumps
or old logs.
Even though average dbh was similar in both
stands prior to logging, average dbh of the harvested
trees was 21.8 cm [8.6 in.] in the marked stand and
23.6 cm [9.3 in.] in the unmarked stand. Thus, the
average volume per tree harvested was 0.09 m3 [3.3
ft3] higher in the unmarked than in the marked
stand. This difference contributed to the higher
volume productivity obtained in the unmarked stand.
With the higher average volume per tree harvested in the unmarked stand, there were also slightly
higher average positioning to cut and processing times
in this stand than in the marked stand. There was
also a greater planning time per tree in the unmarked
stand.

Regression analysis of the time elements and volumes on production per PMH created an equation
designed to predict production levels on the basis of
dbh. Type of treatment (marked or unmarked stands)
was not used in the regression equation because it did
not result ina statistically si gnificantdifference(P<0.05)

sample size = 371 harvester cycles), the resulting regression equation was

or

Vol./PMH (ft1) = -617.22+ 189.31 dbh

Journal of Forest Engineering • 49
Average dbh and the range in dbh for the stands
studied are shown in Table 5. These conditions are
fairly typical of second-growth stands in western
Oregon.
The purchase price of the Timberjack 2518 harvester is approximately US $340,000. The 1992 hourly
owning and operating cost of this machine was
calculated by the PACE program [18] tobe US$88.56/
scheduled machine hour (SMH) for a one-shift operation. Costs per unit volume exclude a profit-andrisk allowance.
If we assume that, on the average, the harvester
processed trees 22.8 cm [9 in.] in dbh and had a
machine-utilization rate of 69%, then productivity
would be 30.8 mVPMH [1,087 ftVPMH] and 21.2
mVSMH [750 ft 3 /SMH] for both the marked and
unmarked stands. Cost per unit volume would then
be US $4.17/m 3 [US $11.81/cunit] in the unmarked
stand. Marking costs were determined by assuming
a US $37.50 marking cost per hour (for labour, paint,
etc.) and a production rate of 0.27 ha [0.67 acre] per
hour; thus, the marking cost would be US $138.90/
ha [US $56/acre]. Given that 239 m 3 /ha [3,418 ft 3 /
acre] were harvested in the marked stand, the marking cost is US $0.58/m 3 [US $1.63/cunit]. Therefore,
cost (including marking) per unit in the marked
stand would be US $4.75/m 3 [US $13.45/cunit].
Forwarder Productivity and Cost
The forwarder was studied for approximately
111 hours over a 3-week period. Production results
for the two-pass and the single-pass techniques are
shown in Tables 6 and 7. The average time per load
ranged from a low of 46 minutes for pulpwood loads
to a high of 67.62 minutes for mixed loads. While
loading the bunk generally took longer with pulpwood than with sawlogs, there was little sorting
involved because sawlogs were typically picked up
in the first pass by the forwarder.
Loading generally took less time with the mixedload technique than with either sawlogs or pulpwood. Unloading, however, took considerably longer
with the mixed-load technique because the roadside
landing was not wide enough to accommodate 2
trailers for the sawlog and pulpwood sorts. Thus,
because of the limited space available at the landing
in this study, unloading with the mixed-load technique included sorting the products at the landing,
loading one product onto a trailer, leaving the second product on the ground, and subsequently load-

ing and moving the second product to another trailer,
sometimes at another landing. The unloading time
would have been substantially decreased with alternative landing operations such as using two trailers
(one for each product) had the landing been wide
enough, loading both product types on one trailer, or
using an independent loader.
Approximately 41% of the 120 loads studied
consisted of sawlogs, 27% consisted of pulpwood,
and 32% were mixed loads. The average distance
travelled to a point where loading began (distance
out) was similar among the treatments, as was the
distance travelled back to the landing (distance in).
However, substantial differences occurred in the
travel distance during loading (travel in unit), which
ranged from 51 m [166 ft] with mixed loads to 111 m
[365 ft] with pulpwood loads. There was an inverse
relationship between logs per load and volume per
load, with fewer logs and higher volumes per load
with sawlogs and a greater number of logs and lower
volumes per load with pulpwood.
Machine utilization was similar among the forwarding techniques. Productivity per PMH was
greatest with sawlogs. The sawlog/pulpwood twopass technique was more productive per PMH and
SMH than the mixed-load, single-pass technique.
However, in situations where 2 trailers could be
positioned side by side at a landing, we could estimate forwarder production by excluding the time
required in our study to reload the sorted product
from the ground and transport it to another trailer at
a different location. In such a case, production with
the mixed-load, single-pass technique would increase to 13.3 mVPMH [468 ftVPMH] and 9.6 m 7
SMH [337 ft 3 /SMH], making the two techniques
(two-pass and single-pass) similar in productivity.
The following regression equation predicted productivity on the basis of indicator variables for product type, volume per load, and distances travelled
(sample size = 120 forwarder cycles):

All variables were found to be statistically significant (P < 0.10) and useful in estimating the productivity of the forwarder under the conditions of
this study. Productivities and costs among the various types of loads as predicted by the regression
equation are shown in Table 8. The cost of the FMG
910 forwarder is approximately US $235,000. The
1992 hourly owning and operating cost of this machine was calculated by using PACE [18] to be US
$70.41/SMH for a one-shift operation. Costs per
unit volumes exclude a profit-and-risk allowance.
Forwarding cost per m3 would be US $6.80 [US
$19.26 per cunit] with the mixed-load technique
(Table 8). Forwarding cost was approximately 43%
higher for pulpwood than for sawlogs.

The two-pass technique involves sorting products in the woods and forwarding one product to the
landing at a time.
t>This column is the total data set for sawlog loads and pulpwood loads.
c
The single-pass technique involves forwarding both products to the landing and sorting there.

In our study, sawlogs comprised 60% of the total
material harvested and pulpwood comprised 40%.
Given this condition, the weighted average cost for
the two-pass technique was the same as that for the
single-pass technique.
Productivity Variation and
Support-Equipment Cost
When the regression equations for the harvester
and forwarder were used to indicate productivity

rates over various values for tree dbh within the
stand studied and distance travelled out by the
forwarder (while other variables were held constant),
harvester productivity ranged from 15.8 m 3 /PMH
[558 ftVPMH] with a dbh of 15.76 cm [6.2 in.] to 43.2
mVPMH [1,526 ftVPMH] with a dbh of 28.76 cm
[11.3 in.] (Figure2). Forwarder productivity dropped
almost 8 mVPMH [282 ftVPMH] within each type
of load as the distance out increased from 60 to 720 m
[200 to 2,360 ft] (Figure 3).

''Predictions based on the following assumptions (average rounded-off values for each variable):
average load sizes are 9.9 m 3 [350 ft3] for sawlogs, 5.7 m 3 [200 ft3] for pulpwood, and 9.3 m 3 [330 ft3]
for mixed loads; average distances are 274 m [900 ft] for distance out, 76 m [250 ft] for travel in unit, and
259 m [850 ft] for distance in; utilization rate is 77%.

The cost of support equipment for the cut-tolength thinning system is US $1.52/m 3 (US $4.30/
cunit). This total is based on equipment usages of 10
h r / d a y for trailers hauling sawlogs and pulpwood,
2 h r / d a y for a crew truck, 2 h r / d a y for a fuel truck,
and 1 h r / d a y for a small all-purpose tractor for

manoeuvring trailers, as well as on a total cost per
day for the support equipment of US $158.55 and a
daily production of 9.4 m 1 [331 ft'] (Table 7).
SUMMARY
Production rates for the harvester in marked
and unmarked stands were not significantly different in this study. The additional cost of tree painting
made the marking technique slightly more costly
than the operator-selection technique. (A subsequent study at this site revealed scarring of residual
trees to be low, with no observable differences between marked and unmarked stands [4].)

The two-pass forwarding technique evaluated
in this study provided more flexibility in locating
trailers along the side of the road and was more cost
efficient than the mixed-load forwarding technique.
The latter would be more efficient with side-by-side
trailer locations. The forwarder operator could then
sort products and load to either trailer.
Study data on production and cost indicated an
operation cost of US $4.17/m 3 [US $11.81/cunit] for
the harvester in the unmarked stand and US $6.80/
m 3 [US $19.26/cunit] for the forwarder. When the
cost of support equipment was added, the total
stump-to-track thinning cost (excluding hauling)
was US $12.49/m 3 [US $35.37/cunit] for this study,
excluding profit-and-risk allowance.
