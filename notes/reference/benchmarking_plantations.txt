    by relevant literature, to create a unique database for benchmarking harvesting systems regarding their
    productivity and supply costs. Current mechanized systems can reach harvesting productivity exceeding
    100 m3 per productive machine hour (PMH), while roadside costs range between 5 and 20 USD m−3 solid
    volume. Harvesting systems are modified continuously to adapt to plantations’ characteristics and industrial
    requirements in the different regions. Local socioeconomic factors and the historical sectorial evolution in each
    region significantly impact the selection of harvesting systems, mechanization levels, type of machinery, and
    resulting harvesting costs. Expanding plantations to more marginal lands requires further research on adapting
    agricultural/construction machinery to steep terrain plantations. International literature tends to represent
    large-scale, highly mechanized systems well. In contrast, fewer studies are available for characterizing small-
    scale systems, particularly in developing regions.

 Australia      Most harvesting operations are conducted on relatively flat terrain with maximum slopes that do not The cost of the most common harvesting systems usually ranges between 11.5 and 23.6 USD/m3 (Annex
                  exceed 15–20%; therefore, they are predominantly harvested with ground-based equipment. Cable             1). These costs depend on several factors, including tree size, tree form and site quality.
                  logging or winch-assisted operations are less common and account for less than 10% of the total log
                  harvest. FT, CTL, and in-field chipping (IFC) are the three major harvesting systems. The FT and CTL
                  systems are the predominant systems in Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus nitens and Radiata pine
                  plantations, while IFC is the predominant system in Eucalyptus globulus plantations (Lambert et al.
                  2006) (Annex 1). The CTL system is the most common in Radiata pine operations. The harvester-
                  processors cut about six to eight log types during harvesting, including 3.7, 4.9, 5.5, and 6.1 m long
                  sawlogs and 2.4–3.6 m long pulpwood logs. Onboard computers installed on harvesters are
                  widespread in Radiata pine operations to collect standard forest production data StanforD data
                  (Strandgard et al. 2013), (Skogforsk 2014) for optimizing cross-cutting and maximizing the value
                  recovery from the log types cut during harvesting. CTL is preferred in Radiata pine operations where
                  the mix of products is complex (i.e.> 10 log assortments). For example, this is the case when tree size
                  is relatively small (< 0.5 m3), when tree quality is poor (bad tree form and high occurrence of
                  branches), or when site fertility is poor. The CTL system is preferred to allow nutrients to remain on
                  the site. The FT and the CTL systems are popular in Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens
                  operations (Acuna et al. 2017), (Ghaffariyan et al. 2019). Harvesters and processors cut short (about 5
                  m) and long (about 10 m) pulpwood logs during harvesting. Onboard computers installed in
                  harvesters are rarely used in these hardwood operations, but some companies are starting to install
                  onboard computers to collect StanforD data. The IFC operations in Australia are conducted on flat
                  areas where operating space for locating the DDCs (delimber-debarker-chipper) landings is not a
                  limitation. Woodchips are hauled to ports or static chip mills, whereas logging residues are either
                  returned to the stump on poor-quality sites or chipped and sold as energy biomass on good-quality
                  sites (Acuna et al. 2012).
 Brazil         As the area of planted forests increased in Brazil, their silvicultural mechanization intensified, and    During the first rotation of clear-cuts on flat terrain, a harvester produces between 19 and 31 m3 PMH−1,
                  harvesting equipment became larger and heavier (Suzuki et al. 2014); hence, harvesters have been          and forwarder productivity varies between 26 and 36 m3 PMH−1. The harvesting and forwarding
                  replaced by feller-bunchers, which are more cost-effective in tree cutting (Bertin 2010). (Lopes and      hourly operational costs (i.e. in April 2018) are described by (Carvalho et al. 2018) to be respectively

                  is the TL method. In this method, trees are felled, delimbed, and topped at the stump area by a
                  chainsaw; then, trees are skidded to the roadside by an elephant, farm tractor, or skidder, depending
                  on slope limitation and available resources. A self-loading truck or a front-ended grapple loader
                  performs the primary transportation of logs. At log the landing, trees are crossed cut into 3, 4, and 6 m
                  long logs and stacked into a pile for auction.Rubberwood: harvesting in Thailand applies both FT and
                  CTL methods. Harvesting techniques can be divided into 1) cutting above the stump and 2) uprooting
                  the stump. For the FT method, trees are felled by chainsaw, extracted by tractor or elephants to the
                  roadside, and then trees are processed into short logs (2 m) and loaded onto the truck either by
                  staffing or mechanized loading by an excavator. Where CTL is implemented, trees are pushed and
                  pulled by a modified bulldozer or excavator until their stumps are uprooted. Then, it was followed by
                  delimbing, cross-cutting with a chainsaw at the stump area, manually stacking, and mechanized
                  loading to the truck by excavator or front-ended grapple tractor.

                  (branches, leaves, and bark that remain on the ground after removing stems) is compacted and
                  bundled by a dedicated bundling machine. Bundles are then extracted by forwarders to the loading
                  area and transported to end customers by trucks. Once at the factory, the bundles are chipped and
                  used to produce the electricity required in the pulp production process or sold as a surplus to the
                  National Electricity System (Sánchez-García 2016). In some areas, productivity studies are underway
                  to explore efficiency gains and safety improvements that may result from fully mechanized systems.
