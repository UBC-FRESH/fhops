    Cable yarding is a well-established practice for wood extraction in mountainous regions in most parts of                                              Received 14 September 2022

    methods, as well as the statistical approaches for model creation were collected. The data gained and the
    associated models were systematically analyzed to compare different yarding systems concerning their
    performance. A set of 98 models was selected for this purpose. Productivity of the investigated systems
    ranges from 1.5 m3/PSH to 69.3 m3/PSH with a mean value of 9.8 m3/PSH where PSH represents the
    productive system hour. A meta-analysis was performed with the data that is presented in the literature
    found to test several hypotheses concerning the influence of different parameters on the performance of
    yarding systems. Various relationships are so strong that regression analysis with the meta-dataset, that is
    mostly containing mean values presented, results in significant correlations. The diversity in problem
    formulation and the corresponding diversity in methodical approaches account for limitations in compar­
    ability of performance. The consultation of guiding literature on forest work studies can promote
    comparability between studies.
