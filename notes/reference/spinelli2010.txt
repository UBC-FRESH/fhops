Productivity Standards for Harvesters
and Processors in Italy

Abstract
The authors developed a general productivity model for the harvesters and processors currently used in Italy. The model
consists of a set of mathematical relationships that can estimate the productivity of these machines under the whole range of
specific work conditions faced in Italy. Such relationships can provide general directions to prospective users and can
contribute to the development of scenario predictions. The original data pool contained more than 15,000 individual timestudy records, each representing a single harvesting cycle (most often one tree). The records were extracted from 38 studies
conducted with the same methods and by the same principal investigators between 1998 and 2008. Statistically significant
models were developed for all cyclic work phases, such as moving, brushing, felling, and processing. Accessory time and
delay time were added as percent factors, also estimated from the same studies. Model development aimed at achieving the
best compromise solution between accuracy and easy use, avoiding the introduction of an excessively large number of input
variables. Selected independent variables were tree volume, tree species, task type (harvesting or processing), machine power
and type, density of residual stand and of harvest trees, stand type, and slope gradient. These models could predict a large
proportion of the variability in the data and were successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same
data pool and not used for model development. Comparison with similar Nordic and German standards confirmed the sound
structure of the Italian models while highlighting the need for specific productivity norms due to the different work
conditions faced by Italian operators.

O

riginating from a purely Scandinavian background,
the mechanized cut-to-length (CTL) system has gained
worldwide acceptance, expanding far beyond the limits of
boreal forestry. The advantages of harvesters and processors
are so attractive that loggers all over the world have adopted
the new technology, applying it to close-to-nature forestry
(Suadicani and Fjeld 2001) and hardwood stands (Wang et
al. 2005). Today, the use of these machines is no longer
limited to gentle terrain (e.g., slope gradient , 25%) and
conifer forests, as demonstrated by their massive deployment in the Austrian (Stampfer 1999) and Swiss (Frutig et
al. 2007) mountain forests. Harvesters and processors also
are very popular in Mediterranean countries, such as Spain,
Portugal (Spinelli et al. 2002), and Italy (Cielo and Zanuttini
2004), where they perform much of the harvesting in the
industrial pine, eucalypt, and poplar plantations.
Such rapid expansion is helped by the remarkable
ﬂexibility of the mechanized CTL concept: cheap, general-purpose prime movers can be converted into effective
CTL units by adding a harvester or processor head
(Johansson 1995). In this respect, earthmoving machinery
provides a good alternative to dedicated forestry units,
offering a robust, multifunctional, and low-cost base (Wang
226

and Haarlaa 2002). Its versatile character allows good
economic results also when the harvester function is used
for a relatively short proportion of the annual work time
(Väätäinen et al. 2004), making it ideal for part-time users.
For this reason, excavator-based CTL units are the ﬁrst
choice when the new technology is being introduced to a
developing market, whereas mature markets prefer highoutput dedicated units (Gellerstedt and Dahlin 1999).
Regardless of application details, mechanized CTL
harvesting brings the industry to the forest, with strong
effects on value recovery (Sondell et al. 2002) and labor
productivity (Chiorescu and Grönlund 2001), hence the
keen interest toward machine performance, whose correct
evaluation is crucial when prospecting the introduction of

CTL harvesting to a new environment (Spinelli and
Magagnotti, in press). The performance of harvesters and
processors has been documented by many studies, conducted over the past decade in almost all the places where these
machines have been deployed. However, most of these
studies offer limited help when making overall predictions
because of their episodic character, which makes them
representative of a speciﬁc case rather than of a general
condition. In particular, single studies are heavily affected
by the erratic variations of the human factor, which may
cause meaningful differences in performance levels: different operators can possess very different abilities (Ovaskainen and Heikkilä 2007) so that overall productivity models
should be based on very large samples where variation
caused by the human factor can be leveled out by including
several professional operators in the same general study
(Nurminen et al. 2006). To date, very few such studies are
available to the international scholar, and they all concern
Nordic operations. Productivity standards have been developed in Sweden (Brunberg 1995, 1997), and a similar
reference is now available for thinning in Finland (Sirén and
Aaltio 2003).
No overall productivity reference is yet available for
central and southern Europe, where the extrapolation of
Nordic results might lead to signiﬁcant errors since working
conditions, operator training, and technological solutions are
quite different and are likely to affect machine performance
(Spinelli et al. 2009a). One typical example is the tree
species: those harvested in central and southern Europe
generally have heavy branching, which is known to decrease
harvester productivity (Glöde 1999).
Hence, there is a need for developing overall productivity
references that may be used for general predictions or
integrated into system simulation models, thus expanding
their scope and increasing their reliability. In fact, a number
of existing spreadsheet models for harvesting simulation
already include the CTL option (Holtzscher and Lanford
1997, Spinelli et al. 2009b), but their extended application is
constrained by the limits of the original data.
The goal of this study was to develop a general
productivity model for the harvesters and processors
currently used in Italy, where mechanized CTL harvesting
was introduced more than 10 years ago and is now
spreading to a large variety of operations (Spinelli et al.,
submitted for publication). Here, the conditions encountered by CTL units are very different from those found in
the Nordic countries and include mountain forests,
hardwoods, close-to-nature forestry, and industrial poplar
plantations. This study aims at calculating a set of
mathematical relationships that can estimate the productivity of CTL units under the whole range of speciﬁc work
conditions faced in Italy. Such relationships can provide
general directions to prospective users and can contribute
to the development of scenario predictions. Furthermore,
the comparison between these eventual standards and
those developed for northern Europe can help gauge the
differences between the Nordic and the southern European working environment, thus addressing the main issues
for future technical developments. Finally, the information obtained from the models can easily be extended to
countries in which work conditions are similar to those in
Italy, at least until speciﬁc local models become
available.

Materials and Methods
The authors compiled the raw data from 38 complete time
studies, conducted between 1998 and 2008 by the
researchers of the Italian National Council for Research. A
general description of the studies is shown in Table 1, which
reports both site characteristics and machine type. All of the
time studies were set up and carried out by the same
principal investigators and with the same methods. Productive time was separated from delay time (Björheden et al.
1995) and split into functional elements, expected to react to
different variables (Bergstrand 1991).
Delay-free time per tree was subdivided into ﬁve basic
elements: move (at roadside or within the stand), brush
(occurring only if operating within the stand), grab (if
processing at the deck) or fell (if harvesting within the
stand), and process (delimbing and bucking). Move activity
within the stand is inherently different from that at the road,
so the two cases were recorded and analyzed separately.
Grabbing a stem from a pile is also different than felling a
standing tree, justifying separate evaluation. On the other
hand, processing was considered to be similar in character
whether conducted in the stand or at the landing, so the data
were combined for analysis, and an indicator variable was
used to check for differences between the two cases, as
suggested for harvesting work studies (Olsen et al. 1998).
The merchantable overbark volume processed during
each cycle was also recorded and associated to the
observation data. All time-motion data were recorded with
Husky Hunter handheld ﬁeld computers running Siwork3
time-study software (Kofman 1995).
Clear-cuts are most heavily represented in the database,
but the proportion of partial cuts is still meaningful (28%).
The stronger representation of clear-cuts is the logical
consequence of their higher proﬁtability, which entails a
better investment capability and therefore favors the
application of mechanized harvesting. Besides, the Italian
mechanized ﬁrms are still comparatively few and can often
choose their work, generally opting for the most proﬁtable
opportunities.
Almost 60 percent of the studies concern general-purpose
prime movers, such as tracked or wheeled excavators,
ﬂexible-legs excavators (so-called spiders), and farm
tractors. In Italy, most loggers are relatively new to
mechanized CTL harvesting and are afraid of the strong
commitment required by the purchase of a dedicated
harvester. Besides, the superior agility of such units might
be unnecessary if they are to be deployed in ﬂatland row
plantations or by the roadside under a yarder.
Some studies investigated the harvesting (felling, delimbing, and crosscutting) of standing trees, while others focused
on the processing (delimbing and crosscutting) of previously
felled trees windrowed or piled at roadside or on the
cutover.
The database represents 19 different professional operators, generally experienced and proﬁcient. Each operator,
however, was a potential source of individual variability,
which must be taken into account when evaluating the
results (Gellerstedt 2002). No attempt was made to
normalize individual performances by means of productivity
ratings (Scott 1973), recognizing that all kinds of normalization or corrections can introduce new sources of errors
and uncontrolled variation in the data (Gullberg 1995). All
operators worked single shifts with occasional overtime so

that fatigue was unlikely to signiﬁcantly affect performance
(Nicholls et al. 2004).
The overall data set contains 15,148 cycle observations
corresponding to 15,366 trees. Multitree handling (i.e.,
handling more than one tree per cycle) was observed on rare
occasions, exclusively when processing felled trees from a
deck. Tree volume ranged from 0.010 to 7 m3, with an
average value of 0.346 m3. Total study volume amounts to
5,239 m3, and study time to 329 hours of net work,
excluding all delays. Average productivity is 46 trees or
15.9 m3 per net hour, excluding all delays.
We used regression analysis of the time-study data to
develop a set of equations capable of predicting cycle time
(and therefore productivity) as a function of statistically
signiﬁcant independent variables. Documented validation is
a prerequisite of production models derived from time-study
data (Howard 1992), and it was conducted according to the
same procedure recently used by Adebayo et al. (2007) for a
228

similar modeling study. The data set was partitioned at
random into two subsets: the ﬁrst subset, containing 70
percent of the observation number, was used to calculate
appropriate productivity relationships through regression
analysis; the second subset, with the remaining 30 percent of
the observations (reserved data), was used to validate the
regressions obtained above. To this purpose, the time
consumption equations were used to predict the reserved
data, then the predicted cycle times were correlated with the
observed cycle times, and the resulting r2 (validated r2) was
used as a measure for the predictive capacity of the
equations. Furthermore, two-sample t tests were used to test
the differences between predicted and observed cycle times.
Table 2 shows a regression matrix for the independent
variables used in conducting the regression analysis of each
time element. Transformations of the independent variables
were chosen on the basis of theoretical as well as empirical
considerations. For example, move time per tree was

expected to be related to distance between trees to be
removed; therefore, the inverse of trees removed per hectare
was used when developing the regression model.
If machine power limits throughput, as it probably does
for at least some portion of each of the time elements, time
to complete a given task is related to power available in the
following fashion: power = work/time or time = work/
power. If more power is available, say, by increasing the
size of the machine’s engine, time for a given task should
decrease. There are likely to be diminishing returns as
power is increased, however, so the transformation of power
included in the regression models for time was power0.5
rather than power1.
Grab and fell are piece-handling activities, so time per
tree would be expected to increase somewhat as tree volume
increased but at a linear or smaller rate until tree size
approached the machine capacity. Processing is a lengthhandling activity, so time per tree should increase less than
linearly with tree volume, again until the machine was
overly taxed. The transformations of tree volume selected
for the regression model were based on these theoretical
considerations as well as the empirical trends.

Results
Table 3 reports the average time consumption per tree, as
extracted from the entire data pool. Data are subdivided by
basic element and refer to a very similar average tree

volume: 0.341 and 0.350 m3, respectively, for processing at
the deck and harvesting within the stand.
Regression analysis of 70 percent of the original data pool
allowed estimating six equations, capable of predicting the
time consumption for each individual work phase, namely,
move time at deck, move time in the stand, brushing time,
felling time, time for grabbing a tree from a deck, and
processing time. Table 4 deﬁnes the dummy (indicator)
variables found to be signiﬁcant for one or more of the time
elements.
Move time at deck when processing prefelled trees was
not signiﬁcantly related to tree volume and was highly
variable. This can be expected because when processing
trees from a deck, the machine can reach many stems from
the same position. Therefore, most of the observations will
have zero move time associated with them. Move time also
depends on a number of factors that could not be included in
the model, such as decking layout and operator ability to
organize the work in the most effective way. The predictive
equation is reported below (n = 5,693, predicted r2 =
0.008). It includes tree volume because the full crane reach
can be used only with smaller trees, whereas larger trees
must be handled at a closer distance. This, as well as the fact
that more small trees can be piled per length of deck,
theoretically justiﬁes more frequent moving when processing larger trees and the consequently longer moving time
per tree:

Move time within the stand while harvesting increased
with slope and the number of residual trees per hectare and
decreased with the number of removed trees per hectare and
with the power of the prime mover. Time per tree was
substantially longer for spider- or tractor-based harvesters,
which are somewhat awkward compared with dedicated
harvesters and excavator base units. The predictive equation
shows a weak correlation (n = 5,643, predicted r2 = 0.091)
although stronger than for Equation 1. Nevertheless, the

Brush time is the time needed to clean the undergrowth
from around removal trees and applies only to harvest (vs.
processing), which involves access to the stand. No brush
time is needed when processing trees from a deck. Brush
time per tree was greater under forest conditions than in
plantations, the latter generally presenting much sparser
undergrowth. This element also had inherently high
variability, as brushing is performed only when necessary,
and therefore more than 95 percent of the observations had
zero brushing time associated with them (n = 5,641,
predicted r2 = 0.020). The predictive equation is as follows:

Grab time from a deck increased with tree size and
decreased with machine power. Spider-based machines took
roughly twice as long as others of the same power to grab a
tree. The coefﬁcient of determination is much higher than in
the previous equations because of a much more stable work
routine. Residuals show a generally good ﬁt (n = 5,693,
predicted r2 = 0.162) across the range of tree volume, which
conﬁrms the overall reliability of the equation reported
below:

Fell time within the stand increased almost linearly
across the observed ranges of tree volume for most

machines. Time decreased with machine power and
increased with gradient for all but the spider-based
harvesters, which seem insensitive to slope gradient during
the felling operation, within the limits explored by the
study. Time consumption was greater for the excavator-,
tractor-, and spider-based machines compared with the
dedicated harvesters. Residuals are a bit low at the upper
end of the volume range, although the magnitudes are
miniscule compared with the mean felling time per tree.

Process (delimbing and bucking) time per tree increased
with tree volume, number of logs, and gradient, while it
decreased with machine power. Stroke processors (vs.
roller or track-type heads) and tractor-based machines
required more time than other types. There was no
signiﬁcant difference between the processing times recorded for roadside work and for work within the stand, other
factors being equal. The mean residuals plot evenly
distributed around the ﬁtted values across the range of
tree volume, indicating that the linear term is appropriate.
There is more scatter of the means at the upper volumes,
although this is due to there being only 45 observations of
trees larger than 3 m3 compared with 8,300 smaller. A
further explanation can be the branching, which is very
variable on large trees and may combine with overall tree
size in making processing particularly difﬁcult. Processing
of chestnut and poplar required less time than for conifers,
other factors being equal. This is logical because poplar
clones are selected for straight stems and are usually
pruned, whereas chestnut is always in the form of coppice
sprouts, generally slender and with few branches. Other
hardwoods—generally branchy and badly formed—took
more time to process than did the conifers. The regression
shown below is highly signiﬁcant (n = 11,324, predicted r2

The validity of all the equations was checked by
comparing the predictions and the actual values for the
second subset, speciﬁcally reserved for the purpose. Table 5
reports the actual and predicted values, the percent error for
the estimates, the results of the paired t test conducted
between the two groups of data (actual and predicted), and
the coefﬁcients of variation for the respective regressions
(actual vs. predicted). Where the paired t test indicated that
the difference between the two groups was not signiﬁcant,
the prediction was accepted as valid. The limit for
signiﬁcance was assumed to be the usual P , 0.05. The
coefﬁcient of variation was taken instead as a measure for
the reliability of individual predictions conducted at cycle
level. The trend was considered valid whenever the
coefﬁcient of variation for the actual versus predicted was
of the same magnitude as the coefﬁcient of variation
recorded for the predictive equations. Four equations out of
six appear to be validated, whereas correction factors should
be applied to the predictions obtained from Equation 2
(Move in stand) and Equation 5 (Fell). The predicted and
actual time elements were summed to obtain total cycle
time. The predicted value for total cycle time is valid for
processing at a deck, whereas it should be corrected for
harvesting. In any case, the error is limited and represents,
respectively, 2 and 3.5 percent. In general, the predictive
equations tend to slightly underestimate time consumption
for the reserved data set, presumably because of random
variation, including that which might be explained by
factors that were not included in the data collection. In the
case of felling, for instance, tree position and tree lean may
have played signiﬁcant roles, but appropriate estimators
were not included in the original record, and therefore it was

not possible to capture and represent the effects of these
variables.
The equations presented above allow estimating cyclic
net time, which can be transformed into scheduled time
consumption by adding appropriate estimates for accessory
time and delay time. In the cases observed, accessory time
consisted mostly of tasks such as slash piling, log stacking,
and log sorting, which are also known to have a signiﬁcant
impact on productivity (Gingras 1996). These tasks are not
cyclic and occur every so often after harvesting or
processing a certain number of trees. Therefore, inaccurate
results can derive from attaching the time consumption for a
speciﬁc occurrence to one speciﬁc observation; for instance,
the amount of slash handled during slash piling generally
belongs to a number of previous cycles and not just to the
cycle during which the action occurs. The allocation of this
time to the respective cycles is laborious and does not
necessarily produce reliable results so that many researchers
simply calculate a constant time consumption per cycle and
add it to the sum of cyclic time (e.g., Nurminen et al. 2006).
As an alternative, one can develop percent coefﬁcients that
relate the duration of accessory time to the duration of
cumulative cyclic time in order to reﬂect the indirect effect
of tree size and shape on accessory time, on the assumption
that bigger trees are likely to produce more slash and that
the redistribution of slash piling time should be proportional
to the amount of slash handled (e.g., Spinelli et al 2009a).
That was the approach followed in this study, where 2
percent coefﬁcients were developed, equal to 14.7 percent
(SD = 34.3) and 29.6 percent (SD = 81.8), respectively, for
harvesting in the stand and processing at the deck. The
development of different coefﬁcients for the two different
work types was justiﬁed by a t test, demonstrating that the
two work types actually presented a signiﬁcantly different
incidence of accessory time (t = 14.5, P , 0.0001, df =
15,138).
Delay time can be added to productive time using
appropriate coefﬁcients in order to reﬂect actual scheduled
time, which is the time to be paid for. This practice is
common in Nordic studies (Kuitto et al. 1994), and speciﬁc
coefﬁcients have recently been developed for harvesters and
processors operating in Italy (Spinelli and Visser 2008).
Such coefﬁcients represent a percent incidence and are
applied to the sum of productive and accessory time to
calculate the duration of delay time. Different coefﬁcients
were developed for harvesting work in natural forests,

harvesting work in plantation forests and processing work
from decks.
An example of the possible use of the models presented in
this article is shown in Figure 1, representing an estimate of
overall productivity for three of the most common cases in
Italy, namely, the harvesting of spruce with a dedicated
harvester (160 kW), the harvesting of plantation poplar with
an excavator-mounted harvester (130 kW), and the processing of hardwood stems at the roadside, with an excavatorbased processor (75 kW). The delay coefﬁcients were 50,
21, and 44 percent, respectively, and the assumed slope
gradients were 25, 2, and 2 percent. The dedicated harvester
was assumed to be working in a spruce selection cut, with a
prescribed removal of 150 trees per ha representing 50
percent of the original tree density. Tree volume has been
adjusted for the respective ranges, and productivity is
reported in cubic meters per scheduled machine hour.

Discussion and Conclusions
This study is unique because of the wide range of
equipment observed and the very substantial size of the data
set, with observations exceeding several times the reference
values presented in a bibliography (Murphy 2005), and
therefore suitable for representing a large variety of
machines and operations. A further asset of the study is
that all data were collected by the same principal
investigators, limiting errors caused by different interpretations of the same data collection protocol (Nuutinen et al.
2008). In fact, the collection of such a large data pool
required approximately 10 years and was a rare endeavor. In
recent years, new automatic data collection techniques have
appeared that will allow for the automatic recording of large
data sets within a relatively short time (Peltola 2003). Even
so, the intervention of the researcher will often be needed
because of the limited ﬂexibility of the automatic data
collection procedure (Väätäinen et al. 2003), hence the
intrinsic value of the present study.
As in numerous previous studies, tree volume was found
to be a primary variable affecting the total time to harvest or
process a tree. Following careful analysis of source data,
this study elected a linear model to represent the relationship
between time consumption and tree volume, as already done
by other authors (Hånell et al. 2000, Sirén and Aaltio 2003,
Nakagawa et al. 2007). However, it is important to
232

remember that not all authors agree on the choice of linear
models, and some prefer to use quadratic equations (Wang
and Haarlaa 2002, Kärhä et al. 2004, Nurminen et al. 2006),
which have also proved acceptable. A quadratic equation
would ﬁrmly establish the concept of diminishing returns,
with productivity inevitably decreasing beyond a certain
point. This could be a logical consequence of the size
limitation inherent to any speciﬁc model, and under this
light quadratic models are conceptually safer, hence the
importance of using the linear models presented in this
article with caution, avoiding extrapolation beyond the
range of tree volumes contained in the origin data, which is,
however, quite wide and ranges from 0.005 to 7 m3. Again,
we note that the trends were clearly linear rather than
quadratic for the observations in this study, indicating that
machine limits had not been reached.
The models also include several other independent
variables, such as slope gradient, stand type, and tree
density, all of which are known to affect time consumption,
especially moving. On the other hand, the models did not
integrate tree selection criteria, which impact productivity
both in thinning (Eliasson 1999) and in ﬁnal cuts (Hånell et
al. 2000). However, the same authors also indicate that the
effect of different selection criteria is often mediated
through variations in tree size so that our models can
indirectly reﬂect tree selection criteria (Eliasson and
Lageson 1999). Like most other models, ours are indifferent
to tree position in the stand, which may explain the
relatively poor accuracy of the equation developed for
felling time.
The study also allowed us to quantify some important
effects of machine type and size, the latter indicated by the
rated power of the prime mover. More power resulted in less
time consumption for the same task, which applied to most
work phases. Head size, as indicated by felling diameter
capacity, did not have any signiﬁcant effect on productivity
when considered in addition to machine power. This is due
in large part to the strong correlation between felling
capacity and machine power, as machine owners generally
selected heads that were well matched to the carriers. On the
other hand, stroke-type heads proved signiﬁcantly less
productive than roller- or track-type heads, as expected.
The analysis also showed that dedicated carriers had
higher productivity than others and in particular that tractors
and spider bases were particularly slow in most tasks,
possibly because of less effective design for the observed
tasks. In particular, the loaders on these machines lack the
agility of the parallel cranes mounted on dedicated
harvesters and the power of excavator booms. On the other
hand, spider-based units were the only ones to be found
indifferent to slope gradient when felling, which makes
them an interesting option for steep-terrain harvesting. In
fact, the models developed with the study can help
determine a breakeven slope gradient above which a
spider-based harvester will offer better results than a
dedicated unit, thanks to its superior steep-terrain mobility.
In this respect, Figure 2 shows the results of a simulation
conducted for a hypothetical spruce stand with removals of
150 trees per ha (50% of the original stocking), and an
average tree size of 0.3 m3. The simulation included the
same 160-kW dedicated unit described earlier and an 88-kW
spider-based harvester. Slope gradient varied from 0 to 50
percent—the simulation indicates that beyond a 40 percent

= 0.3 m3).

slope gradient, the spider is more productive than the
dedicated harvester.
In contrast to some other studies, we did not ﬁnd any
explicit productivity effects of clear-fell versus thinning,
although these discrete differences may have been partly
covered by the signiﬁcant effects of removal and residual
trees per hectare on move time and by the pervasive effect
of tree size, which is strongly correlated to silvicultural
treatment. In fact, clear-fell is being progressively banned
from Italian forests by limiting the area of clear-cuts. Group
or single-tree selection represents the main type of maturity
cut applied to Italian forests, with the exception of coppice
stands and short-rotation plantations. Coppice trees are
generally felled by chainsaw because of the inherent
difﬁculty of cutting multiple trees sprouting from the same
stump so that processors rather than harvesters are used in
coppice harvesting operations. Therefore, the only real
clear-fell work performed by Italian harvesters is in poplar
and pine plantations.
The models presented in this study are relatively accurate
and can explain a large proportion of the variability in the
process. The remaining error most likely depends on a
number of other variables that were not included in the
study. Some of these were difﬁcult to introduce because
their translation into suitable indicators would have required
a subjective judgment by the researcher. This would be the
typical case of such factors as working technique, operator
proﬁciency, and operator experience, which do have a
signiﬁcant impact on productivity (Ovaskainen et al. 2004,
Dvořák et al. 2008). Other variables were easier to record,
and some of them were indeed recorded for at least part of
the 38 origin studies. These are the number of logs, the
number of log sorts, and a tree form coefﬁcient. The number
of logs sorts may have a signiﬁcant effect on productivity
(Brunberg and Arlinger 2001) and is not difﬁcult to record.
Tree form can be represented by appropriate numeric codes,
as already done by other authors over the years (Raymond et
al. 1988, Emeyriat et al. 1997, Puttock et al. 2005).
However, it was estimated that the inclusion of these
further factors into the model would have complicated its
use more than it would have increased its value. The risk
was that users could be overwhelmed by the number of
FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL

Vol. 60, No. 3

input data necessary for the model to return its estimate and
would provide approximate ﬁgures, thus canceling the
beneﬁt of increased model accuracy. Requiring only a few
and relatively simple input data, this model was designed to
offer a best-compromise solution and prove both user
friendly and reasonably accurate.
Finally, it may be interesting to see how the Italian
productivity standards, tentatively developed with this
study, compare with the standards reported by other authors
for other countries. To this purpose, three general models
were selected, all designed to represent a cross section of
mechanized operations in a given country and generally
based on large data sets. Two models were those developed
for Sweden and Finland, respectively, by Brunberg (1995)
and Nurminen et al. (2006), already mentioned in the
introduction of this article. A third and very interesting
model was developed by Purfürst (2007) in Germany, using
an extremely large data pool made of the records extracted
from the onboard computers of about 30 machines. All three
models calculate productivity after excluding delays longer
than 15 minutes, and their results are not directly
comparable to those obtained from the Italian model, which
estimates productivity after including all delay time.
Therefore, the delay factors on the Italian model were
changed for the purpose, by applying a reduction factor of
0.39, also calculated from Spinelli and Visser (2008). The
Italian comparison treatments were clear-fell harvesting of
spruce and poplar, performed with a dedicated harvester, in
order to reﬂect conditions similar to those in the foreign
studies. The results are reported in Figure 3. The estimated
productivity for the harvesting of Italian spruce is the
lowest, and it is somewhat nearer to the estimate for
Germany than to those for Finland and Sweden. That may
partly depend on the heavier branching of Alpine spruce so
that the descending southern gradient of spruce harvesting
productivity might be related to a comparable and
increasing branching gradient. In a way, Nordic softwood
stands may offer conditions that are more similar to Italian
poplar plantations than to alpine spruce forest, which might
be the reason for the very similar productivities achieved in
both stand types. In fact, the estimated productivity for
Italian poplar is extremely close to that obtained for
Swedish spruce, with the two graph lines almost overlap-

Italian poplar with those obtained from some other popular
models for softwood harvesting.

ping. The results of this comparison are a good witness to
the sound structure of the Italian models, which return
reasonable and justiﬁable ﬁgures. At the same time, they
highlight the speciﬁc conditions of Italian forest operations
and support the need for speciﬁc models.
