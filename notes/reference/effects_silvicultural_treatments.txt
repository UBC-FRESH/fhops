         ABSTRACT

         Increasingly, alternative silvicultural methods have
         been considered to meet the demand for
         nontimber values such as visual quality and
         biodiversity in the Pacific Northwest. The
         successful implementation of these alternative
         silviculture treatments requires careful
         consideration of economics and operational
         efficiencies in timber harvesting. This study used
         detailed time study and shift-level data to assess
         the effect of alternative silvicultural treatments on
         the production and cost of cable harvesting in
         western Washington. Four silvicultural treatments
         were examined: clearcut, two-age, patch cut and
         thin, and group selection. Silvicultural treatments

         greatly affected the production and cost of timber
         harvesting, especially in felling and yarding
         processes. The average yarding cycle time (3.74
         minutes/cycle) in the clearcut unit was shorter
         than those in other partial cutting treatment units
         because there were no residual trees to work
         around and higher harvest volumes per acre,
         compared with the partial cut units. The average
         tree size greatly affected yarding cost: the
         clearcut unit had the second-highest yarding cost
         ($52.38/thousand board feet [mbf]) because of the
         smallest piece size (69.6 board feet/piece). Stump-
         to-truck cost for this study ranged from
         $70.49/mbf for the patch cut and thin to
         $120.19/mbf for the group selection. Carriage
         types and yarding direction also had an impact on
         yarding productivity.

         Forest management practices in the Pacific
         Northwest are changing to reflect increased public
         demands for addressing nontimber values such as
         structural and biological diversity as well as
         aesthetics and wildlife habitats (Curds et al. 1998,
         Reutebuch et al. 2002). These demands often call
         for implementing alternative silvicultural practices
         (i.e., partial cutting) with less-intensive harvest of
         trees (Johnson 2002, Reutebuch et al. 2002) and
         more emphasis placed on the ecological
         perspective (Keegan et al. 1995). Partial cutting
         treatments are not new to forest management in
         the Pacific Northwest, but land managers and
         contract loggers often voice concerns about
         increased logging costs and operational

         requirements resulting from the protection of
         environmental values while producing timber
         (Arnott and Breese 1997). This type of
         management is complicated further by the fact that
         there are no commonly accepted procedures that
         dictate how partial harvest treatments are
         implemented, administered, or evaluated (McNeel
         and Dodd 1996).

         Successful implementation of the alternative
         silvicultural treatments is, in part, dependent on
         the operations being economically efficient while
         meeting the landowner's objectives for the stand
         (Coulter 1999). Potential financial returns are
         important criteria for forest managers to consider
         when planning a timber harvest. Generally,
         clearcutting is accepted as being less expensive
         than partial cutting. Higher harvesting productivity
         or low harvesting cost often is associated with
         clearcuts because workers and machinery do not
         have to maneuver around residual trees, machines
         have to move less because of higher volumes
         removed per area, and hooking times are shorter
         because of higher concentrations of downed timber
         (Kellogg etal. 1996a, 1996b, Howard et al. 1996).

         Harvesting productivity commonly decreases with
         partial cutting because care must be taken to
         minimize damage to residual trees and equipment
         travel times are longer when trees are spaced
         farther apart. However, other factors such as an
         increase in average tree size may make up for
         productivity losses incurred due to reduced harvest
         intensity per acre (Kluender et al. 1998). Planning
         and layout is an integral part of timber harvesting
         and the cost (dollars per acre) of planning and

         harvest layout is influenced by the amount of
         harvest volume per acre and silvicultural
         treatments. The planning of a partial harvest may
         take anywhere from two to seven times longer
         than planning a clearcut because of the amount of
         detail needed in laying out the skyline corridors,
         with the result that planning costs associated with
         partial cutting are higher than those associated
         with clearcutting (Kellogg et al. 1998).

         Another challenge in the Pacific Northwest is that
         the topography is often too steep (more than 35%)
         to be harvested effectively by ground-based
         harvesting systems. Although ground-based
         harvesting systems can work on slopes of up to
         50%, their production is considerably diminished
         as the upper slope limit is approached (Conway
         1982). Cable harvesting systems often are used to
         harvest timber in steep terrain, but cable
         harvesting costs are more sensitive to alternative
         silvicultural treatments than ground-based
         harvesting systems. For example, Daigle (1992)
         found that the cost of tractor logging in partial
         harvests was between O and 16% greater than the
         cost of logging clearcuts. In contrast, cable
         logging costs for partial cutting were 19 and 4%
         above clearcutting costs. He suggested that several
         factors contributed to the difference in the
         increase in cable logging costs, including the large
         amount of time spent during corridor changes and
         the large labor inputs required for yarding
         activities (i.e., typically three to four people are
         directly related to yarding activities in a cable
         logging). Increased number of landing and road
         changes and smaller turn sizes also contribute to
         higher cable logging costs in a partial cutting

         (Hochrein and Kellogg 1988). Economic concerns
         become greater when alternative silvicultural
         treatments are implemented using cable systems
         because these systems have higher costs than
         ground-based harvesting systems in a partial
         harvesting (Daigle 1992).

         Implementing alternative silvicultural systems in
         coastal conifer stands of the Pacific Northwest
         using cable systems is being considered more
         frequently, and there is a need to enhance our
         knowledge of how to efficiently and economically
         implement alternative harvesting practices. The
         objectives of this study were to compare the
         productivity and cost of cable harvesting among
         four different silvicultural treatments and to
         identify what factors influence them.

         Study Area and Methods

         Four different silvicultural treatments were located
         on a 242-ac study area in the Capitol State Forest
         in Olympia, Washington (latitude, 46.85° N;
         longitude, 123.15° W). The stands were primarily
         (89-97%) stocked with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
         menzesit), but also supported small components of
         western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western red
         cedar (Thuja plicata), red alder (Alnus rubra), and

         bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum). The average
         dbh of the merchantable (i.e., conifer) species was
         19 in . The elevation of the site is approximately
         500 ft above sea level and the slope ranged from
         15 to 57%. All cutting units were located outside of
         riparian management areas and were not required
         to leave buffers. Table 1 summarizes the mean site
         conditions for each of the four silvicultural
         treatments. These treatments include

         * Clearcut. Even-aged prescription that removed
         100% of trees in the harvest unit. Because
         clearcutting is the traditional and most common
         harvesting practice in this area, we have chosen to
         use it as the reference treatment for this study.
         We will use this reference as the basis of all
         comparisons between silvicultural treatments.

         * Two-age. Uneven-aged prescription, in which
         approximately 15 trees/ac are retained until the
         next rotation.

         * Patch cut and diin. Uneven-aged prescription that
         removed about 20% of the overstory, in patches
         of 1.5-5 ac with thinning in between the openings,
         resulting in a stand that contains five separate age
         classes. The patch cut and thinning operations
         were not separated to analyze the overall effect of
         this type of treatment.

                                                                                over the
         harvest unit.

         One logging contractor conducted all four
         silvicultural treatments. The contractor was familiar
         with the use of cable harvesting systems in partial
         cutting operations and he had been performing
         partial harvest using these systems for 10 years.
         Felling was done either by a Timbco 445-D feller-
         buncher with a Quadco (Prince George, BC,
         Ganada) hot saw head for flat or moderate slopes
         (less than 40%), or by a contract faller using a
         Stihl 064 chainsaw (Oceana West Industrial Park,
         Virginia Beach, VA) with a 34- in . bar for steep
         slopes (more than 40%). Both manual and
         mechanical felling methods were used in the group
         selection and patch cut, with the mechanical felling
         used in the thinning sections and manual felling
         was used in the clearcut patches. The clearcut unit
         was felled mechanically, and the two-age unit was
         felled manually (Table 2).

         Yarding was done using a Washington 78SL swing
         yarder (Trican Machinery, Ltd., New Westminster,
         BC, Canada) run by a crew of four with 5-30 years
         of experience: a yarder operator, a rigging slinger,
         and two choker-setters. The yarder had a 47-ft
         tower and was capable of yarding distances of
         1,800 ft. The yarder was used in different
         configurations (standing and running skyline

         systems and uphill and downhill yarding ) and with
         an assortment of carnages to facilitate yarding of
         the harvest units (Table 3). The equipment
         configurations were determined by the contractor,
         in accordance with his views on the most
         productive setup for the site. During yarding
         three carriage types were used: Eagle Eaglet
         motorized clamping carriage, a mechanical slack
         pulling (MSP) carriage and a grapple carriage.
         The MSP carriage and the grapple carriage were
         used in downhill yarding situations in one of the
         clearcut patches with a running skyline setup. For
         material smaller than 17 in ., large-end diameter,
         whole trees were yarded to the landing where trees
         were processed with an excavator-based Cat 32OD
         with a Fabtec (Menomnee, MI) processing head in
         all units. All material larger than a 17- in . small-
         end diameter was processed at the stump using a
         chainsaw. A Link-Belt heel boom loader was used
         to load tree length logs onto the trucks at landing.

                                                  A detailed

         All the productive elements and delays were
         measured to develop predictive equations for
         average cycle time for yarding operations. The
         productive yarding cycle was divided into six

         elements: outhaul, lateral out, hooking, lateral in ,
         inhaul, and unhooking. The elemental times in
         seconds were collected using a Husky fex21 field
         computer (Lexington, KY), with the Time Study
         Data Logger program (Itronix, Spokane Valley, WA)
         (Wang 2001). Along with the elemental times,
         independent variables also were collected and
         related to the average yarding cycle time models.
         The independent variables collected were yarding
         distance, lateral distance (except for when
         grapple yarding was used in the patch cut and
         thin unit where lateral distance was not collected),
         number of pieces per cycle, carriage type, and
         yarding direction. Delays in the productive cycle
         were recorded also in three categories: (1)
         operational-downtime during the cycle such as
         hang-ups, losing logs, decking problems, and
         others; (2) mechanical-downtime caused as a
         result of machine failure; and (3) personal-
         downtime caused for other than mechanical or
         operational reasons.

         Shift-level data are the daily production
         information of a machine or person per shift
         recorded by each operator at the end of the day
         throughout the operation. A time log was kept on
         all the machines for the entire harvest so that the
         detailed information could be compared with the
         daily production , to make sure that there were
         no errors made. No detailed time study data were
         collected for felling, processing, and loading. Shift-
         level data were used to estimate production rates
         for these activities. The daily production data
         for each piece of equipment were used to derive a
         cost per unit of volume for each piece of
         machinery on each harvesting unit.

         The data collected in the detailed time studies
         were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet,
         where an initial screening of data was performed.
         Outliers were screened and removed from the data
         set if they were more than 3 SDs from the mean.
         After the outliers were removed, the data were
         transferred to SAS version 8.02 (SAS 2001) where
         multivariate ordinary least squares regression
         analysis was preformed to develop models of
         delay-free cycle time. Tree and log size information
         was calculated using the preharvest cruise and
         scaling data. The scaling data were obtained from
         the mill to which the logs were taken, where the
         logs were scaled according to the westside Scribner
         log rule. Logs were identified by truck scale tickets
         and were able to be differentiated by sale unit. The
         scaling data were used to determine average
         volume per piece for each unit and also the
         weighted average was used to determine average
         piece size for the sale.

         Machine rates were calculated for each machine
         that was used in the harvesting of each of the
         study units. The machine rates were calculated
         using the method outlined by Miyata (1980).
         Several assumptions were made to calculate
         machine rates, and they are summarized in Table
         4. The machine rates for all machinery are listed
         in Table 5. For this study the yarder had the
         highest total cost per scheduled machine hour
         (SMH) because of high labor cost associated with a
         four-person crew.

         treatments because of the differences in density of
         residual standing timber and felling methods (Table
         6). Mechanical felling was used in the clearcut unit
         as well as the thinning sections of the patch cut
         and thin and group selection units. The average
         production rates of the mechanical felling were
         not statistically different in the patch cut and
         group selection units with production rates of
         32.4 trees/SMH and 28.0 trees/SMH, respectively,
         and 65.7 trees/SMH in the clearcut. Mechanical
         felling costs were 176% higher in the partial
         cutting areas ($17.74/thousand board feet [mbf])
         than in the clearcut unit ($6.42/mbf). The cost per
         mbf was calculated by multiplying the trees per
         hour production rate by the average standing
         tree volume and dividing the machine rate for the
         felling system by that product. Manual felling
         productivity was approximately 12.01 trees/SMH
         (or $15.78/mbf) in the clearcut sections of the
         patch, group selection, and two-age treatments. It
         was expected that manual felling production
         would have decreased also because of the care
         necessary to avoid hang-ups and undue damage to
         the residual stand (Kellogg et al. 1996b). Felling
         productivity, however, was not affected because of

         the high fraction of trees felled in the sections
         where manual felling was used. In the calculation
         of felling cost, an average tree volume of 263.41
         board feet (bd ft) was used, which was estimated
         from the presale cruise.

         Processing productivity was consistent throughout
         all the silvicultural treatment units because
         processing occurred independently from the
         yarding activities. There were no processing
         production data collected from this study, and we
         used the processing production information from
         a previous study that used a similar processor in
         comparable tree sizes (Coulter 1999). The
         processing production rate used in the cost
         calculation was 11.45 mbf/SMH, which resulted in
         a unit processing cost of $10.99/mbf. Log trucks
         were loaded from a cold deck, by a loader
         dedicated to loading only, resulting in a consistent
         production in loading for all the silvicultural
         treatment units studied. On average, five trucks
         were loaded per day 'with an average payload of
         4.276 mbf/truck load. The hauling distance to the
         mill was 250 mi one way, and each truck made
         only one trip per day. This resulted in a loading
         cost of $25.03/mbf.

         minutes) and twoage (4.44 minutes), and the
         group selection (4.88 minutes) had the longest
         average cycle time (Figure 1, Table 7). The outhaul
         time was relatively similar throughout the
         treatments, with significant differences between
         the two-age and patch cut; and the clearcut and
         group selection were caused' by the differences in
         the external yarding distance of each unit.The
         time spent pulling cable laterally was significandy
         higher in the two-age unit (46.61 seconds/cycle; P
         < 0.0001). This unit had a steeper ground slope
         than the other units and a large amount of logging
         slash on the ground, which resulted from
         processing large trees at the stump. The slash
         interfered with the choker-setter's movement.
         Hooking time was the shortest for the clearcut and
         the two-age units (clearcut, 42.88 seconds/cycle;
         two-age, 47.69 seconds/cycle. The abundance of
         timber on the ground, timber mechanically felled
         and bunched (clearcut), and large trees (two-age)
         attributed to the quick hooking time.

         Time for lateral- in to the carriage was influenced
         by residual trees and the felling method. The two-
         age and group selection units, which required the

         greatest amount of yarding through standing
         timber, had significantly higher cycle times for
         lateral- in than clearcut and patch cut (Tukey's
         honestly significant difference [HSD], P < 0.001).
         The logs and trees in the group selection and two-
         age units had to be worked around residual trees
         during the lateral-cable- in process, slowing the
         process of returning the cable to the carriage. In
         the patch cut, the trees in the single tree selection
         thinning area were mechanically felled and placed
         in bunches near the skyline corridors to facilitate
         the lateral- in process. In the areas that were
         grapple yarded the lateral distance was recorded
         as O ft; thus, there was no lateral-out or lateral- in
         time. The residual trees in the two-age and group
         selection units also caused longer times for the
         inhaul process because the logs had to be pulled
         through a residual stand. Unhooking time was
         similar across the treatments with the exception of
         the group selection. Although all units used the use
         of electronic chokers, the unhooking time for the
         group selection unit was longer because of
         mechanical problems with the chokers. To facilitate
         data analysis, the mean unhooking time for all the
         turns recorded, excluding the unhooking times for
         the group selection, was used to provide an
         estimate of unhooking time for the group selection
         unit.

         Regression models for delay-free cycle time were
         developed, using the common independent
         variables of lateral yarding distance, yarding
         distance, and number of pieces per cycle for all
         the harvesting units (Table 8). For the models all
         the coefficients were significant except for the
         coefficient on pieces per cycle in the group

         selection model, which had a value of P = 0.351,
         and the coefficient on lateral distance in the two-
         age model, which had a value of P = 0.144. The
         coefficient for pieces per cycle was positive and
         statistically the same in magnitude, except that
         the patch cut coefficient was significantly higher
         than the clearcut. Similarly, the coefficient for the
         lateral distance variable was positive with
         statistically the same magnitude, except that the
         patch cut variable was significantly higher than the
         two-age unit. In the patch cut model, dummy
         variables were used to examine the effect of
         carnage type and position of the yarder (uphill
         versus downhill yarding ). The coefficients that
         were significant for the patch cut model in
         addition to pieces per cycle, lateral distance, and
         yarding distance were the coefficients for the
         grapple carriage and yarding direction. Both
         coefficients were found to have negative signs,
         which signify that both the grapple carriage and
         the uphill yarding resulted in lower cycle times
         than downhill yarding and slack pulling carriages.
         The combined model was developed based on all
         the data from the different silvicultural units and
         resulted in a general model for skyline yarding
         productivity on this study, including dummy
         variables to account for differences in silvicultural
         treatment, carriage type, and position of the
         yarder.

         Delays

         Delays caused significant differences in overall
         cycle time (Figure 2, Table 9). During our field
         observations, we found that mechanical
         malfunctions of the old yarder constituted the

https://www.proquest.com/docview/198664200/fulltext/FBFA34464329482DPQ/1?accountid=14656&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals         Page 15 of 27

         majority of the total delay time, accounting for 43
         and 85% of the delays for the two-age and patch
         cut units, respectively. The patch cut unit had some
         large mechanical problems with the yarder; in
         addition, the carnage type was changed three
         times. Consequently, over 50% of the average total
         cycle time for the patch cut unit was made up by
         delays. Twenty-seven percent of the average cycle
         time for the patch cut was attributed to
         mechanical delays. The clearcut and group
         selection units had no appreciable mechanical
         downtime observed in this study. Operational
         delays such as hang-ups with residual trees and
         deck management at landings were highest in the
         two-age unit (7.33% of the observed time),
         compared with 1.63% in clearcut, 0.43% in patch
         cut, and 0.26% in group selection units.

                                                corridor
         was not included in the road changes because it
         was done independently from yarding activities.
         Pulling the strawline was treated as a working
         delay only if it interfered with yarding activities.
         Less time was spent on road changes in the
         clearcut unit than any of the other units (Figure 3).
         Because there were no standing trees between the
         corridors in a clearcut, the cables did not have to
         be pulled all the way back to the yarder before
         moving to the next corridor. The shorter yarding
         distances in the clearcut and group selection units
         contributed to fast road change times. The fast
         road change times and the low delay times in the
         clearcut resulted in the highest utilization rate
         (productive machine hour [PMH]/SMH, 87%). In
         contrast the two-age unit had the lowest utilization
         (73%) because of increased operational delays
         (i.e., hang-ups) and high percentage of road
         change time. The patch cut and group selection
         units had utilization rates of 76 and 85%,
         respectively.

         Carriage Type and Yarding Direction

         In the patch cut unit, three different types of
         carriage were used during the yarding operation
         and this affected yarding production . The
         grapple carriage required significantly (Tukey
         HSD, P < 0.0001) lower average cycle time than
         other carnages, and the motorized and MSP
         carriage had similar average cycle times (Table 10).

         Although the cycle times for the grapple carriage
         were lower, the production rate with that carriage
         was low because the grapple carriage could yard
         only 1 tree/cycle. The motorized and MSP carriages
         yarded between 1 and 7 logs or trees/cycle. The
         grapple carriage would have to reduce its average
         cycle time by 1.16 minutes to equal the
         productivity of the other types of carriages. Felling
         pattern also affected the efficient use of carriages.
         When the trees were felled perpendicular to the
         contours of the hill, it was difficult for the
         grapple carriage to be quickly positioned on a log.
         If the trees had been felled parallel to the contour
         it would have been more conducive for the use of
         a grapple carriage.

         cycle time for downhill yarding . This equated to
         approximately an extra 16 turns/day, or an
         additional 4.18 mbf/day, assuming an average
         number of 2.6 logs/turn and an average log volume
         of 100.6 bd ft. A lower harvesting cost might have

         approximately 2.5 trees/turn, except when a

         yarded 1 tree/turn. Although the clearcut unit had
         the fastest average cycle time, it had the second-
         highest cost as it was observed in this study
         because the average volume per piece was lowest
         (69.6 bd ft/piece) in the clearcut unit. The average
         piece sizes in the patch cut and two-age treatment
         were nearly twice that of the clearcut (Table 11).

         The stand conditions varied between silvicultural
         treatment units (Table 1). To determine the effect
         of silvicultural treatments on the harvesting cost,
         we standardized the variables that were contained
         within the parameters of the developed models. On
         this standardized basis, the clearcut unit had the
         lowest cost of $46.10/mbf (Table 12). The group
         selection treatment had the highest cost because
         of the highest average time per cycle and the
         second-lowest volume per piece. This unit had a
         relatively low harvest intensity (10.7 mbf/ac),

         downtime. This follows the pattern that was seen
         in the yarding cost because yarding was the
         most costly of the harvesting cost components.

         Conclusion

         The difference in silvicultural treatments greatly
         affected the cost and production of harvest
         operations, especially in felling and yarding
         production . In silvicultural treatments that had
         higher levels of residual trees and had those
         residuals uniformly dispersed throughout the
         cutting blocks (i.e., no large openings), the
         production of both felling and yarding
         operations was observed to decline due to the
         increased care needed to avoid damage to residual
         trees. This study clearly showed that there was an
         increase in felling cost for both manual and
         mechanical felling methods as the amount of
         residual timber increased. Silvicultural treatment
         had its biggest impact on yarding productivity and
         cost because of increased time for skyline road
         changes and yarding cycles. As expected, the
         stand with the lowest number of residual trees per
         acre resulted in the shortest amount of time spent
         for road changes.

         Average tree size, yarding direction, carriage
         type, and felling patterns all interacted with
         silvicultural treatment to influence total harvesting
         cost. Because of different initial stand conditions or
         smaller average tree diameters clearcut did not
         result in the lowest costs, as would be expected.
         In this study the patch cut had the lowest
         yarding cost ($24.73/mbf) and lowest total
         stump-to-truck cost ($70.49/mbf), and the

         clearcut had the third-lowest yarding cost
         ($52.38/mbf) and second-lowest total stump-to-
         truck cost ($89.22/mbf). This difference was
         caused by mainly the differences in tree size of
         the two units. As the size of the logs increase,
         yarding productivity was significantly increased
         without impacting on overall average yarding
         cycle time.

         The type of carriage used should be matched to
         felling methods and operational conditions. The
         data showed that the grapple carriage was less
         productive than the other yarding systems used,
         especially when trees were felled perpendicular to
         the contour. The fellers assumed that a motorized
         or MSP carriage was going to be used. Instead, the
         yarding contractor decided to use a grapple
         carriage and spent much time to cast or pivot the
         grapple carriage to hook the logs. Had the timber
         been felled along the contour rather than
         perpendicular to the contour, the grapple carriage
         would have been much more efficient and the
         findings might have been different. Yarder location
         was another factor that affected the total cost of
         harvest. When yarding downhill, yarding
         productivity was notably reduced because of the
         care needed to keep the logs under control while
         moving them downhill.

         Under a scenario of uniform initial conditions
         among the stands, we found that the clearcut, as
         expected, would return the lowest logging cost,
         followed by the two-age and patch cut harvest,
         with a group selection harvest being the highest
         cost alternative. Harvesting cost increased as tree
         retention levels increased (i.e., decrease of the

         number of trees removed per acre) and as the
         retained trees were more interspersed throughout
         the cutting unit (i.e., large openings [≥ 1.5 ac]
         were not used).
