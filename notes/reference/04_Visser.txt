                     Excavator-based shovelling machines can be used on steep terrain to improve the safety and
                     productivity of cable yarder extraction. Shovelling felled timber across to a yarding corridor
                     limits the number of line-shifts required, and feeding the grapple carriage reduces cycle time

                     Piece size had the strongest impact on productivity. Mean utilization was 61%. 20% of

                                3. Results
The daily production data shows the dramatic effect
of piece size on machine productivity (Table 2). While
mean cycle time ranged from 104 to 233 s, mean pro-
ductivity ranged from 23 to 114 m3/PMH and the
smallest piece size systematically corresponded to the
longest cycle time and the lowest productivity. At site
#1, the machine negotiating the smallest piece size
took a longer time than all the others in order to ac-
cumulate an average three-pieces load, and yet could
not match the load size achieved at the other sites,
falling far behind in terms of productivity. The table
also shows a very clear trend for load size, which con-
tained an average three pieces for very small stems
(0.5 m3), about two pieces for large stems (~2 m3) and
only one piece for very large stems (>3 m3) that were
close to reaching the payload capacity of the yarder.
    The elemental time study provided further insights
into the factors affecting work performance. Accumu-                                             Fig. 3 Mean cycle time by task and site
