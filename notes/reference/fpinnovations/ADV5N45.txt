Abstract

The Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada (FERIC) studied mechanized
processing in cable yarding operations in northern British Columbia. Two danglehead
processors were monitored in five cutblocks to determine processing productivity and
costs, the amount and cost of loader support required, and the effects of slope and other
factors on productivity.

Introduction
Mechanized processing is the norm for
most British Columbia interior operations
and is becoming more prevalent in coastal
British Columbia (Kosicki and Dyson
2004a). Most mechanized processing takes
place on gentle to moderate terrain harvested
with ground-based extraction systems. Increasingly, however, companies are trying to
find ways to use mechanized processing in
steeper areas, often in conjunction with
cable yarding. On steep slopes, mechanized
processing at the stump is usually not
feasible, so processing is performed at
roadside after the stems are extracted.
Canadian Forest Products Ltd.’s (Canfor)
Mackenzie Operations1 asked FERIC to
study its use of mechanized processing on
cable yarding operations. Canfor uses a
short-wood harvest system for all of its
Mackenzie operations. On steep terrain, a
swing yarder, loader, and processor are used
in the operation. The yarder usually works
independently while the loader usually sorts
and piles the processed logs for the processor.
Processing on steep slopes to produce
short logs has many challenges not found in
more moderate terrain or with a long-wood
system. Because the yarder, loader, and

processor must often work closely together,
conflicts can result. In very steep areas, a
loader is required to deck the stems for the
yarder, while the processor may require the
loader to reposition the stems before
processing. As well, the short-wood system
generates many logs and sorts with associated
sorting and decking challenges. As this
combination of equipment is relatively new,
little is known about the factors that affect
processor productivity and costs when
working on steep slopes, or about the amount
of loader assistance necessary to support a
processor working on steep slopes.
In the winter of 2003/04, FERIC
monitored two danglehead processors
working in five cutblocks in Canfor’s
Mackenzie operations. This report presents
productivity and cost information, the
amount and cost of loader support required,
and the effects of slope and other factors on
productivity.

Objectives
The objectives of this study were to:
• Determine the overall productivities and
costs for processing in winter conditions.

• Determine the amount and type of
assistance that the loader provided to the
processor, and calculate the associated
costs.
• Determine the effects of slope and other
site and stand factors on processor
productivity.

Site and stand
descriptions
Processing operations were studied in
five cutblocks. Blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4 were
located approximately 120 km north of
Mackenzie, near the Ospika River. Block 5
was located approximately 35 km southwest
of Mackenzie, near the south end of Williston
Lake. The harvesting prescription in all cases
was clearcutting. The first four blocks were
classified as the Graham variant of the
Engelmann Spruce - Subalpine Fir moist very
cold biogeoclimatic subzone (ESSFmv4)
(DeLong et al. 1994). The fifth block was

classified as the Mossvale variant of the
Sub-Boreal Spruce moist cool biogeoclimatic
subzone (SBSmk1) (Delong et al. 1993).
Elevations ranged from 800 to 1250 m. Table
1 summarizes the site and stand descriptions.
The slopes in the blocks ranged from 0
to 85%. The steepest terrain was in Blocks 1
and 2 (Figure 1) and the gentlest terrain was
in Block 4. Forest cover was dominated by
mature subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), hybrid
white spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii),
and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), with
minor amounts of paper birch (Betula
papyrifera) and trembling aspen (Populus
tremuloides).

Trees were felled and bunched with a
feller-buncher on slopes up to 60%. The
remaining areas on steeper slopes were

yarded with swing yarders equipped with
mechanical slackpulling carriages and
radio-controlled chokers. Mobile backspars
were used with the swing yarders wherever
possible.
All stems were yarded tree length to
roadside, then delimbed and cut to length
with danglehead processors (Figure 2). The
machines processed the stems and sorted
them into piles on the road for the loaders
to clear away. The heelboom loaders piled
the debris (tops and limbs) on the low side
of the road to create flat areas where necessary,
and then stacked the processed logs on the
debris piles (Figure 3). The processors and
loaders worked together, and they worked
independently of the yarders whenever
possible. However, on very steep slopes, the
loaders were needed to deck the stems for the
yarders and a yarder, loader and processor all
worked together. The machines were scheduled
to work 12-hour shifts, seven days per week,
and were frequently double-shifted during
the study period. Specifications for the processors and loaders are presented in Table 2.
During processing, the stems were
delimbed, manufactured into short logs, and
then sorted by size and species. Generally, pine
and spruce were combined into one species
group and subalpine fir was placed in a
separate sort. Up to 10% subalpine fir could
be included in the pine-spruce sorts for the
ground-based harvesting, while for cable
harvesting the processors were not required
to separate the subalpine fir but did so where
feasible. Each species group was separated
into three colour-coded sorts that were
categorized by top diameter (yellow: 10–
18 cm, blue: 18–23 cm, and red: 23–36 cm),
while the largest logs were placed into a
headrig sort (top diameter >36 cm) for a
total of seven sorts. The target length was
5.0 m for all logs except for the red sort where
it was 6.2 m.
Before settling on this current system for
processing stems from steep slopes, Canfor
experimented with hauling the stems tree
length to a satellite yard for processing into
short logs. However, this added approximately

Study methods
FERIC observed the processing operation
and collected shift-level, detailed-timing, and
work sampling data. Shift-level data, consisting
of Servis recorder charts and operators’ reports
about operating time and delays (>10 min/
occurrence) were collected for the processing
phase over three months in four study blocks
(Blocks 1, 2, 3, and 5) for one processor and
four operators. Detailed-timing data were

Hourly processor and loader costs were
calculated using FERIC’s standard costing
methods (Appendices I and II) and were
applied to the productivity to determine costs
per cubic metre. Equipment costs were calculated using a 12-hour shift, with provisions
for overtime for time worked over 8 hours.
Generic costs were used for the carriers based
on the approximate weight classes of the
machines used in the study. Although the
loaders spent a substantial amount of time
travelling back and forth between the
processor and the log decks (Figure 4) and
therefore undercarriage wear would be higher
than in stationary applications, this was not
accounted for in the costing.

stem sizes were similar at 0.76 m³ for the
Hyundai/Waratah and 0.71 m³ for the John

Hyundai/Waratah in m³/PMH was the
lowest in Block 5, where the average stem
size was the smallest and the processor
spent much of the time working with the
yarder. Productivity for both processors was
highest in Block 3, which had the largest
average stem size. Generally, productivity
tended to increase as piece size increased. The

and he considered the regular operator of the

Delays 11%

Piling processed

Idle 1%

Waiting for processor 8%

The overall proportion of time spent
performing the various elements of the
processing cycle was similar for both machines
(Table 5). The processors spent between 56
and 90% of the time processing stems. Debris
handling, decking, and sorting times were
minimal as the loader usually performed
these tasks. However, the Hyundai processor
spent a substantial amount of time in Block
3 waiting for the loader and the yarder
because all three machines worked together
on five of the six timing samples. The loader
was required to grab the stems from the
yarder to prevent them from sliding back
down the hill due to steep terrain and icy
conditions. The loader that loaded the
logging trucks in Block 4 also assisted the
processor, because the loader that usually
assisted the processor was broken down. The
terrain there was quite flat and provided
ample room to deck the processed logs.
Therefore, the processor did not spend much
of its time waiting for the loader.
Work sampling results

The work sampling results for the loaders
are shown in Figure 5 and include data for
all three loaders. Overall, the loaders spent
72% of their time assisting the processors.
These activities consisted of the following:
• piling processed logs
• travelling—moving back and forth
between the processor and the log decks

Truck loading 5%
Assisting yarder 3%

• repositioning unprocessed stems—
breaking the pile apart, straightening and
untangling the stems, and pulling the
stems up closer to the road
• site maintenance—building up areas to
place the processed logs and clearing
debris
• other miscellaneous productive time
The loaders spent 8% of their time
assisting the yarder or loading trucks, and
9% of their time waiting for the processor
and being idle.4 They spent the remaining
11% of their time in delays.
The amount of decking space available
had an influence on loader efficiency. The
terrain and the number of log sorts dictated
how far the loader had to travel from the
processing site to the nearest suitable decking
area. Because of the multiple log sorts and
the generally steep ground, the loader often
had to carry the logs substantial distances to
find a decking location (up to 100 m and
averaging 25 m).
When the yarded stems were decked
farther away from the edge of the road, the
loader pulled the stems closer to the road so
the processor could reach them. The large
processor could reach farther than the small
processor and, therefore, required less
assistance for this task. However, it was also
more productive, so the loader spent more
time travelling and piling logs when working
with the larger processor. The Hyundai
290LC loader was more powerful and had a
larger grapple than the other two loaders.
Therefore, it was more efficient when
assisting the processor. However, this loader
was usually dedicated to loading trucks and
was not involved much in the study.
Overall productivity and system
costs5

Applying the study’s overall utilization
rate of 78% for the Hyundai/Waratah
processor6 to the detailed-timing results
yielded overall productivities of 30 m³/SMH
for the Hyundai/Waratah processor and
40 m³/SMH for the John Deere/Waratah
processor (Table 6). This resulted in

processing costs ranging from $2.94/m³ to
$4.70/m³. The average cost for the John
Deere/Waratah was 10% less than the
Hyundai/Waratah, at $3.52/m³ and $3.90/m³,
respectively. The higher productivity of the
John Deere/Waratah offset its higher hourly
machine cost. The cost of having a loader
working full-time with a processor ranged
from $2.02/m³ to $3.59/m³. This cost was
less when the loader worked with the John
Deere/Waratah processor because of this
processor’s higher productivity. The combined
system cost for the processor and loader averaged $6.30/m³ for the John Deere/Waratah
and $7.13/m³ for the Hyundai/Waratah.
Effects of slope and other factors
on processing productivity

The detailed-timing observations for the
Hyundai/Waratah processor for one operator
(29 stem decks) were analyzed to test the
effects of slope and other variables on
productivity. When correlation analysis was
done on processing time only, processing time
was moderately well-correlated with stem size
and stem deck slope, and weakly correlated
with ground slope. There was no correlation
between processing time and branchiness
or defects. Regression analysis was then
performed to develop a relationship between
time and the variables. The only significant
variable was stem size (r2 = .25).

Discussion
The processing productivities reported
in this study are within the range Kosicki
and Dyson (2004a, b) found in a study on
Vancouver Island for producing long logs
from grapple-yarded decks using a Waratah
4

During the study, the loaders worked with the yarders
on only 12 decks and performed truck loading duties
on only 8 decks. For the rest of the time, they were
dedicated to the processors.
5
Productivities and costs are based on gross stem volumes
with no deductions for stem defects. Actual net
productivity based on processed logs loaded out would
be lower and costs would be higher.

Productivities and costs are based on gross stem volumes with no deductions for stem defects. Actual net productivity based on
processed logs loaded out would be lower and costs would be higher. b From Table 4. c Overall average from shift-level study (Table 3).

HTH624 processing head mounted on a
Madill 3800 carrier. Their study showed
productivities of 56 and 38 m³/PMH for
average stem sizes of 1.01 and 0.44 m³, respectively. The slopes for the blocks in their
study ranged from 5 to 80%.
While one of the objectives of this study
was to look for a relationship between slope
and processor productivity, it became evident
that the following factors had a much greater
effect on productivity than slope:
• processor size—the larger processor was
more productive than the smaller one
• equipment combination—the processors
were the most productive when working
with just the loader, less productive when
working with the loader and the yarder,
and least productive when working
alone7
• stem size—of the variables tested
(ground slope, deck slope, stem size,
defects, and branchiness), only stem size
had a significant effect on processing
productivity
Although the natural ground slope at
the site occasionally affected processing, the
effect was not consistent. On the steepest
ground slopes, the stems would be piled either
on a landing, in the ditch on the uphill side
of the road, or on debris on the downhill
8

side of the road. This meant that the deck
slope was a better predictor of productivity.
However, the influence of deck slope on
productivity could not be isolated because
further analysis showed that deck slope
was closely correlated with stem size which
obscured its influence.
The effect of deck height on processor
productivity was not quantified, but FERIC
observed that one operator preferred decks to
be no higher than the bottom of the machine’s
cab. Where feasible, the John Deere/Waratah
operator would pull stems from the high
decks to make a lower pile before he began
processing. This seemed to be time well spent
as the operator could then process the stems
very quickly. Another operator said that he
preferred the deck to be no higher than eye
level from his position in the machine’s cab.
If it was higher than the cab, he had to stoop
to see the stems. Stems piled on the low side
of the road and below the road surface level
7

Most of the timing samples were conducted when the
processor and loader were working together. There
were two samples when the processors were working
alone because the loader was broken or working with
the yarder. In these cases the loader returned later to
help deck the processed logs. The average stem size
varied in the different machine combinations working
together.

were also difficult to see, especially at night,
because the machine’s lights didn’t shine on
these stems. The operator had to move the
machine to the edge of the slope and sometimes off the road to illuminate these stems.
Yarding distance and volume per hectare
influence deck height, so the block layout
can impact deck height.
The position of the stem deck also affected
processing efficiency. The processor needed
the loader to clear the logs more frequently
when the decks were parallel rather than
perpendicular to the road, because the
processor needed room to turn these logs
during processing. This was more common
on steep ground, where the stems were
yarded from below the road and decked in
the ditch on the high side.
The short-wood system for this study
used seven sorts, so finding adequate decking
space for all the sorts was difficult on steep
terrain. The number of sorts was consistent
throughout the study, so it could not be
determined whether the number of sorts
affected productivity. Another FERIC study8
has shown that the number of sorts affect
processing productivity on steep slopes.
This study occurred in the winter when
many of the limbs were removed during
yarding. In icy conditions, the stems became
very slippery and sometimes slid off the
decks, resulting in time lost to retrieve these
logs. Productivity may be different during
summer conditions

Summary and
conclusions
The results of this study show that
mechanized processing at roadside can be
productive and cost effective when cable
harvesting on steep slopes. The larger John
Deere/Waratah processor with an above
average operator was 34% more productive
than the smaller Hyundai/Waratah processor
with an average operator. The average cost of
processing was $3.52/m³ (gross) for the John
Deere/Waratah and $3.90/m³ (gross) for the
Hyundai/Waratah. Operations were most

productive when the processor and loader
were able to work independent of the yarder.
Loaders spent 72% of their time assisting
the processors. Most of this time involved
piling processed logs and moving back and
forth between the processor and the log
decks. The combined system cost for a
processor and a loader averaged $6.30/m³ for
the John Deere/Waratah and $7.13/m³ for
the Hyundai/Waratah .
The influence of site and stand conditions
on productivity was analyzed. However, a
relationship could not be detected for most
of the variables tested. Stem deck slope and
stem size had the highest correlation with
processing time, but stem size was the only
variable that had a statistically significant
effect.
FERIC is currently studying processors
working with cable yarders in summer
conditions, and will publish the results in an
upcoming report.
Future studies could assess whether
decking space and height affect productivity.

Implementation
The following recommendations
should improve the efficiency and productivity of processing operations on steep
cable-harvested slopes:
• Wherever possible, the processor and
loader should work independent of the
yarder. Lay out and harvest blocks to
minimize situations where a loader is
required to assist the yarder with landing
the logs. In very steep terrain, yard the
stems to a landing instead of to roadside
to prevent the decked stems from sliding
back down the hill.
• Deck the stems as close to the road edge
as possible when yarding so they are
within easy reach for the processor. This
will reduce the need for a loader to pull
the decked stems closer to the road. Also,
deck the stems as straight as possible so

communication, October 2004.

the processor or loader does not have to
straighten or untangle the logs before
processing.
• Yard the stems to areas where there is
sufficient decking room nearby for the
processed logs. If it is steep on the low
side of the road, try to yard to areas with
gentle slopes on the high side of the road
where the processed logs can be decked.
• Wherever it is possible to do so without
compromising yarding chance, locate the
haul roads to provide an abundance of
adjacent flat areas for decking the
processed logs. This will reduce the time
required for the loader to travel to the
decking areas with the processed logs.
• When the yarder, loader, and processor
are working together, more supervision
will reduce conflicts and improve
efficiency.
• When the loader must work with the
yarder, consider if it is more efficient for
the processor to process alone in another
location and move and sort its own
logs, with the loader leaving the yarder
periodically to service the processor.
Organize the activities to keep the
phases separate.
• Reduce loader travel time by estimating
which sorts will be the most common
in a stem deck and then locate the most
common sorts closest to the processor.
• When the yarder is working in an area
that has adequate space for it to land its
own logs without assistance from a
loader, the loader should work elsewhere
with the processor, and return periodically
to the yarder to clear the logs as necessary.
