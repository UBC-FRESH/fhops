                     SURVEY OF
         MECHANIZED PROCESSING EQUIPMENT
                  Evaluation of the
             Caterpillar DL221 Processor
                                            J.T Peterson*

         Summary and Conclusions
         The objective of this study was to measure the productivity and cost of a
         Caterpillar DL221 processor working in coastal old -growth timber. The study
         was done at MacMillan Bloedel Limited's Northwest Bay Division on Vancouver
         Island, B.C.

         FERIC monitored the machine's performance in two areas for five days in
         January 1987. The machine processed 26 trees per productive machine hour
         ( PMH), for a volume produced per scheduled machine hour (SMH) of 20.4 m 3 .
         Costs were $5.44/m 3 or $8.〇6/tree.

         Machine utilization was low during the study period (52.6%) but our observa-
         tions indicate a 73% utilization rate is achievable. This would result in a
         production rate of 226.4 m 3 per 8-hour shift for a cost of $3.93/m 3 . To
         achieve this utilization level, modifications must be made to the processor.

         Well prepared windrows of trees are critical for efficient, cost-effective
         mechanical processing. Trees should be presented with butts facing the road
         and piled parallel to each other. The absence of a dirt bank caused by road
         construction also facilitates processing efficiency. This was highlighted in
         the study when a well prepared windrow of trees and the absence of a dirt bank
         resulted in a 90% increase in the number of trees processed per PMH.


         Introduction
         Many coastal operations have smallwood old-growth stands in which 90% or more
         of the stems have a butt diameter of less than 60 cm. These stands could be
         mechanically processed with a suitable machine.

The concept of the Caterpillar DL221 processor originated with Tanguay
Industries Ltd. , St-Prime , Quebec , with the first prototype produced in 1 982.
To assess the Caterpillar DL221 processor 's suitability for processing West
Coast timber , Finning Tractor & Equipment Co. Ltd. of Vancouver , B.C. con-
ducted initial f ield trials near Vancouver in 1 986. After some modifications
to the processing head , the machine was transported to Vancouver Island for
further f ield trials. In January 1987, FERIC was asked to monitor and report
on a demonstration trial being conducted near Buckley Bay , B.C.


S i t e a n d System D e s c r i p t i o n
The study site was located on the east coast of Vancouver Island, 1 6 km west
of Buckley Bay , B.C. Species composition, by volume , was 5〇E balsam fir, 39%
western hemlock , and 11% western red cedar. The stand had 454 stems per
hectare , with a net volume per hectare of 690 m 3 .

A Madill 084 grapple yarder was used to yard timber which had been either
handfelled or mechanically felled . Trees were yarded to the roadside and
windrowed along the road (Figure A ). After processing , logs were loaded by a
Caterpillar 225 log loader , and highway hauled to the dryland sortyard near
Parksville , B.C.

The study site included two different operating areas：

     Area A   -   wood was feller-bunched and grapple yarded to windrow
              -   level ground (±5%)
              -   most trees in the windrow had butts facing the road
              -   absence of dirt bank at roadside

     Area B   -   handfelled and grapple yarded to windrow
              -   windrow on downhill side of road
              -   windrow contained many bucked logs (some cedar logs up to
                  1 50 cm in diameter )
              -   windrow also contained many trees with tops facing the road
              -   dirt bank, up to 3 m in height (Figure A), on downhill side
                  of road ( caused by road construction)
              -   slope on lower side of road varied from 3〇 to 50%

A knuckle-boom loader stroke , plus a backward stroke by a hydraulic cylinder ,
is used to process trees. The full extension of the boom, in addition to the
backward stroke of the tree-holding grapple , results in a total extended
length of 12.2 m (Figure B). The processing sequence ( Folkema 1982) includes：

     1)   Load Tree       -     (Figure C) the boom grapple is extended to a tree and the
                                tree is drawn to the tree-holding grapple. The tree-
                                holding grapple then closes and secures the tree.

     2)   Delimb/         -     (Figure D) the knuckle-boom is extended, thereby
          Measure/              delimbing the tree with the delimbing knives and
          Buck                  grapples. For longer trees, the knuckle-boom and the
                                backward stroke cylinder are extended simultaneously.
                                At the maximum extension of the boom, the roles of
                                the two sets of grapples are reversed and the boom is
                                retracted. This reciprocating action is repeated
                                until the desired log length is reached. The tree is
                                then bucked or topped by the topping saw.

    3)    Reverse Log -         The log is retracted and piled,
          to Unload

Table 2 shows the observed time-distribution summary. "Process" time includes
the functions of loading the tree , delimbing , measuring , bucking , unloading
the tree, and the required swinging time to do these functions. Processing
time averaged 1 .2 min/tree in Area A and 1.6 min/tree in Area B. FERIC
observed the delimbing efficiency and quality to be good on limbs up to 8 cm
in diameter.

handfaller. Ten percent of the combined total time was spent in this func-
tion. The handf elled windrow contained more bucked logs than the mechanically
felled area.

The "Swing Trees" category represents the time spent swinging trees whose tops
faced the road ( Figure E). These trees were swung and placed in piles
(parallel to the road) for subsequent processing. The windrow in the hand-
felled area contained significantly more trees that required swinging. As a
result , 15% of productive time was spent swinging trees in the handfelled area
(Area B) versus 3% in the feller-bunched area (Area A).

                     FIGURE E.   Processor Swinging Tree.


The limiting factor on the processor 's ability to lift and swing trees was the
holding power of the delimbing grapple. A tree that approached the maximum
lifting capacity was a Douglas-f ir , (62-cm diameter , 26-cm top diameter ,
28.8-m long , and 3270 kg). The processor was only able to lift this tree
slowly and swing it approximately 1 0 m before i t dropped out of the grapples.

"Move" time is the time spent travelling along the windrow while processing.
The dirt bank on the lower side of the road in Area B was up to 3 m in height
in places. This dirt bank interfered with the operator 's ability to see and
with the machine's ability to align itself with trees. Also , it caused the
windrowed trees to lie at a steeper angle than was necessary and they tended
to slide downhill when disturbed . In Area A , the trees were better aligned
and most of the butts faced the road, so less moving was required by the
processor. FERIC feels that a rotating-head featur e would significantly
reduce the amount of machine move time involved .

The mean values and the standard deviation for "Process" time were computed by
tree diameter class to show the range of values observed in the study (Table 3)•
Times ranged from a low of 0.35 min/tree to a high of 4.72 min/tree. Mean
times progressively increased with increasing tree diameter size . The mean
processing times in Area B were consistently higher than those in Area A.
This was caused by the steeper angle of the windrow and the number of tangled
trees. Volume produced per minute is also shown in this table. There is a
progressive increase in production as the trees get larger.

Non-product ive time includes all delays no matter what their duration. A
detailed summary of non-productive time is shown in Table 4. The majority of
mechanical delays (66%) were in the saw category and included chains breaking,
chains jumping off, and bent bars. The other major delay (19%) was caused by
the boom-level-monitoring cable breaking.

FERIC feels that improvements can be made which will increase machine utiliza-
tion. Suggestions made to Finning Tractor & Equipment Co. Ltd. include:

     1)   Boom-Level-      -   increase cable size or monitor a different way
          Monitoring Cable     (rods, electrical, electronic eye , other ).

     2)   Engine Cover     -   change or modify the tie-down clamps to ensure
                               they will not come undone while machine is
                               operating.

     3)   Saw Bar and      -   change to a bar and chain more suited to high-
          Chains               speed service.
                           -   modify head to allow bar to retract further into
                               sheath and/or increase amount of guarding.

If the visitors time (148 min), the boom-level-monitor ing-cable repair time
( 1 20 min), the engine cover time ( 1 3 min), and only one-third of the saw-
repair time ( 1 36 min) is converted to productive time, the machine utilization
increases to 73 percent. FERIC believes that this machine utilization level
can be achieved if modifications are made to the processor. Finning Tractor &
Equipment Co. Ltd. have advised FERIC that they are undertaking a program to
improve this machine.

The labour rate used in the cost analysis is the current B.C. IWA rate plus
35% burden (Appendix). Machinery costs are estimated by FERIC and are based
on information from equipment and supplies distributors and use a standard
owning , repairing , and operating formula format. Costs such as supervision,
overhead, and crew and equipment transportation are not included. Also ,
interest or opportunity costs are excluded from the machinery costs reported
in the text, but are listed in the Appendix. Tree volumes were based on FERIC
measurements in the stand.

The Area A operation produced costs of $3-1 8/m 3 or $4.20/tree, with a volume
of 280 m 3 per 8-hour shift. With a utilization level of 73%, costs in Area A
would be $2.73/m 3 . Area B produced costs of $6.42/m 3 or $10.02/tree, and a
volume of 1 39 m 3 per 8-hour shift. Given a utilization level of 73%, the
Area B cost would be $4.45/m 3 .
