SURVEY OF
MECHANIZED PROCESSING EQUIPMENT
Evaluation of the
Caterpillar DL221 Processor
J.T Peterson*
Summary and Conclusions
The objective of this study was to measure the productivity and cost of a
Caterpillar DL221 processor working in coastal old -growth timber. The study
was done at MacMillan Bloedel Limited's Northwest Bay Division on Vancouver
Island, B.C.
FERIC monitored the machine's performance in two areas for five days in
January 1987. The machine processed 26 trees per productive machine hour
( PMH), for a volume produced per scheduled machine hour (SMH) of 20.4 m 3 .
Costs were $5.44/m 3 or $8.〇6/tree.
Machine utilization was low during the study period (52.6%) but our observations indicate a 73% utilization rate is achievable. This would result in a
production rate of 226.4 m 3 per 8-hour shift for a cost of $3.93/m 3 . To
achieve this utilization level, modifications must be made to the processor.
Well prepared windrows of trees are critical for efficient, cost-effective
mechanical processing. Trees should be presented with butts facing the road
and piled parallel to each other. The absence of a dirt bank caused by road
construction also facilitates processing efficiency. This was highlighted in
the study when a well prepared windrow of trees and the absence of a dirt bank
resulted in a 90% increase in the number of trees processed per PMH.

Introduction
Many coastal operations have smallwood old-growth stands in which 90% or more
of the stems have a butt diameter of less than 60 cm. These stands could be
mechanically processed with a suitable machine.

The concept of the Caterpillar DL221 processor originated with Tanguay
Industries Ltd. , St-Prime , Quebec , with the first prototype produced in 1 982.
To assess the Caterpillar DL221 processor 's suitability for processing West
Coast timber , Finning Tractor & Equipment Co. Ltd. of Vancouver , B.C. conducted initial f ield trials near Vancouver in 1 986. After some modifications
to the processing head , the machine was transported to Vancouver Island for
further f ield trials. In January 1987, FERIC was asked to monitor and report
on a demonstration trial being conducted near Buckley Bay , B.C.

S i t e a n d System D e s c r i p t i o n
The study site was located on the east coast of Vancouver Island, 1 6 km west
of Buckley Bay , B.C. Species composition, by volume , was 5〇E balsam fir, 39%
western hemlock , and 11% western red cedar. The stand had 454 stems per
hectare , with a net volume per hectare of 690 m 3 .
A Madill 084 grapple yarder was used to yard timber which had been either
handfelled or mechanically felled . Trees were yarded to the roadside and
windrowed along the road (Figure A ). After processing , logs were loaded by a
Caterpillar 225 log loader , and highway hauled to the dryland sortyard near
Parksville , B.C.

A knuckle-boom loader stroke , plus a backward stroke by a hydraulic cylinder ,
is used to process trees. The full extension of the boom, in addition to the
backward stroke of the tree-holding grapple , results in a total extended
length of 12.2 m (Figure B). The processing sequence ( Folkema 1982) includes：
1)

Load Tree

-

(Figure C) the boom grapple is extended to a tree and the
tree is drawn to the tree-holding grapple. The treeholding grapple then closes and secures the tree.

2)

Delimb/
Measure/
Buck

-

(Figure D) the knuckle-boom is extended, thereby
delimbing the tree with the delimbing knives and
grapples. For longer trees, the knuckle-boom and the
backward stroke cylinder are extended simultaneously.
At the maximum extension of the boom, the roles of
the two sets of grapples are reversed and the boom is
retracted. This reciprocating action is repeated
until the desired log length is reached. The tree is
then bucked or topped by the topping saw.

3)

Reverse Log to Unload

The log is retracted and piled,

Table 2 shows the observed time-distribution summary. "Process" time includes
the functions of loading the tree , delimbing , measuring , bucking , unloading
the tree, and the required swinging time to do these functions. Processing
time averaged 1 .2 min/tree in Area A and 1.6 min/tree in Area B. FERIC
observed the delimbing efficiency and quality to be good on limbs up to 8 cm
in diameter.

"Move Logs " is the time spent moving logs which were already processed by the
handfaller. Ten percent of the combined total time was spent in this function. The handf elled windrow contained more bucked logs than the mechanically
felled area.
The "Swing Trees" category represents the time spent swinging trees whose tops
faced the road ( Figure E). These trees were swung and placed in piles
(parallel to the road) for subsequent processing. The windrow in the handfelled area contained significantly more trees that required swinging. As a
result , 15% of productive time was spent swinging trees in the handfelled area
(Area B) versus 3% in the feller-bunched area (Area A).

*

FIGURE E.

Processor Swinging Tree.

The limiting factor on the processor 's ability to lift and swing trees was the
holding power of the delimbing grapple. A tree that approached the maximum
lifting capacity was a Douglas-f ir , (62-cm diameter , 26-cm top diameter ,
28.8-m long , and 3270 kg). The processor was only able to lift this tree
slowly and swing it approximately 1 0 m before i t dropped out of the grapples.
"Move" time is the time spent travelling along the windrow while processing.
The dirt bank on the lower side of the road in Area B was up to 3 m in height
in places. This dirt bank interfered with the operator 's ability to see and
with the machine's ability to align itself with trees. Also , it caused the
windrowed trees to lie at a steeper angle than was necessary and they tended
to slide downhill when disturbed . In Area A , the trees were better aligned
and most of the butts faced the road, so less moving was required by the
processor. FERIC feels that a rotating-head featur e would significantly
reduce the amount of machine move time involved .
The mean values and the standard deviation for "Process" time were computed by
tree diameter class to show the range of values observed in the study (Table 3)•
Times ranged from a low of 0.35 min/tree to a high of 4.72 min/tree. Mean
times progressively increased with increasing tree diameter size . The mean
processing times in Area B were consistently higher than those in Area A.
This was caused by the steeper angle of the windrow and the number of tangled
trees. Volume produced per minute is also shown in this table. There is a
progressive increase in production as the trees get larger.

Non-product ive time includes all delays no matter what their duration. A
detailed summary of non-productive time is shown in Table 4. The majority of
mechanical delays (66%) were in the saw category and included chains breaking,
chains jumping off, and bent bars. The other major delay (19%) was caused by
the boom-level-monitoring cable breaking.

FERIC feels that improvements can be made which will increase machine utilization. Suggestions made to Finning Tractor & Equipment Co. Ltd. include:
1)

Boom-LevelMonitoring Cable

increase cable size or monitor a different way
(rods, electrical, electronic eye , other ).

2)

Engine Cover

-

change or modify the tie-down clamps to ensure
they will not come undone while machine is
operating.

3)

Saw Bar and
Chains

-

change to a bar and chain more suited to highspeed service.
modify head to allow bar to retract further into
sheath and/or increase amount of guarding.

-

If the visitors time (148 min), the boom-level-monitor ing-cable repair time
( 1 20 min), the engine cover time ( 1 3 min), and only one-third of the sawrepair time ( 1 36 min) is converted to productive time, the machine utilization
increases to 73 percent. FERIC believes that this machine utilization level
can be achieved if modifications are made to the processor. Finning Tractor &
Equipment Co. Ltd. have advised FERIC that they are undertaking a program to
improve this machine.
The labour rate used in the cost analysis is the current B.C. IWA rate plus
35% burden (Appendix). Machinery costs are estimated by FERIC and are based
on information from equipment and supplies distributors and use a standard
owning , repairing , and operating formula format. Costs such as supervision,
overhead, and crew and equipment transportation are not included. Also ,
interest or opportunity costs are excluded from the machinery costs reported
in the text, but are listed in the Appendix. Tree volumes were based on FERIC
measurements in the stand.
The Area A operation produced costs of $3-1 8/m 3 or $4.20/tree, with a volume
of 280 m 3 per 8-hour shift. With a utilization level of 73%, costs in Area A
would be $2.73/m 3 . Area B produced costs of $6.42/m 3 or $10.02/tree, and a
volume of 1 39 m 3 per 8-hour shift. Given a utilization level of 73%, the
Area B cost would be $4.45/m 3 .
