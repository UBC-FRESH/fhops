Abstract

Harvesting systems, Loader-forwarding, Soil disturbance, Productivity, Costs, Interior
British Columbia.

Introduction
To provide information on costs and
productivities for alternative harvesting
techniques aimed at minimizing soil
disturbance, FERIC has an ongoing program
to study ground-based harvesting on steep
and/or sensitive sites. Two case studies that
have been completed include a Trans-Gesco
clambunk skidder working with a loaderforwarder on moderately steep slopes
(Kosicki 2001), and low ground-pressure
skidders working in northwestern B.C.
(Henderson 2001). In the summer of 1999,
FERIC and Ainsworth Lumber Co. Ltd.
studied a loader-forwarding operation on
moderately steep ground as an alternative to
cable extraction on three cutblocks in the
interior of British Columbia. Both hand
falling with loader-forwarding and hand
falling with cable yarding were used during
harvesting. For the purpose of this report,
only the loader-forwarding operations were
studied.

Objectives
The primary goal of this study was to
assess the economic and operational feasibility
of using hydraulic log loaders to forward
timber in moderately steep clearcut blocks.
The following specific objectives were set:
• Determine overall productivities and
costs for the loader-forwarding operation.
• Determine the proportion of cutblock
area occupied by loader-forwarding trails.
• Identify operational factors affecting
performance of the harvesting phase
and recommend improvements where
appropriate.

Site description
The study sites were located approximately
40 km southwest of Lillooet in Ainsworth’s
Timber Supply Area within the Kamloops
Forest Region (Figure 1). The sites were
classified as dry very cold (dv) and moist warm
(mw) subzones within the Engelmann
Spruce-Subalpine Fir (ESSF) biogeoclimatic
zone (Lloyd et al. 1990). Table 1 summarizes
site and stand attributes for the three
cutblocks.

The silvicultural system for all three
cutblocks was clearcut with the preferred
harvest method stated as cable yarding, and
with hoe chucking (loader-forwarding) as an
alternative. Cutblock 21 was harvested entirely
by loader-forwarding, whereas Cutblocks 24
and 13 utilized both cable yarding and loaderforwarding timber extraction methods.
Cutblock 21 had low to moderate ratings
for site sensitivity to soil degrading processes,
and had a maximum soil disturbance level
of 10% as stated within the silviculture

high to very high ratings, and each had a
maximum soil disturbance level of 5%.
Streams within the cutblocks were
classified as S5 and S61 and had riparian
management zones of 30 and 20 m, respectively.
The two drainages had numerous avalanche
chutes used by foraging mammals including
grizzly bear. Wildlife tree patches 1.9 to
3.2 ha in size were established adjacent to
or near the avalanche chutes to provide
shelter and habitat.

Harvesting system and
equipment
Pietila and Sons Logging Ltd. of Lillooet,
B.C. harvested the loader-forwarding portion
of all three cutblocks. This harvest method
was new to the crew. The cutblocks were
manually clear-felled and only the high-value
peeler logs were bucked to length and
delimbed at the stump. The forwarding was
done primarily by two Kobelco SK 300-LC
hydraulic log loaders working independent
of each other. Occasionally, either machine
would be used to load the trucks.
Truck loading was done primarily by a
Kobelco SK 220-LC hydraulic log loader,
but this machine also forwarded stems to
roadside occasionally. A landing bucker
bucked and delimbed the stems as they were
spread out at the decking areas (Figure 2).
When time permitted, the bucker delimbed
stems within the cutblock and/or reduced
the height of stumps along the loaderforwarding travel path.
The Kobelco SK 300-LC has an
operating weight of approximately 33 tonnes.
The width of the machine is 3.6 m, with
each track measuring 80 cm wide. The
standard configuration has a static ground
pressure of 0.48 kg/cm 2. The clearance
below the machine is approximately 80 cm.
The grapples on the two machines are
slightly different in size; one opens to a width
of 1.32 m, and the other to a width of
1.64 m. Both machines have a reach of
approximately 10 m.

The Kobelco SK 220-LC is slightly smaller,
with an operating weight of approximately
25 tonnes and width of 3.5 m. The track width
is 80 cm wide, and static ground pressure is
0.39 kg/cm2 for the standard configuration.
The clearance below the machine is
approximately 72 cm. The grapple has an
opening of 1.45 m, and the reach of the
machine is approximately 9.5 m.
The cutblocks and roads were laid out
for cable yarding. Although sections of the
road had steep cutbanks and fill slopes, the
excavators were able to access the cutblocks
in various locations (Figure 3). The most
difficult area was along the road at the adverse
sections of Cutblock 13, where the fill slopes
were consistently steep. Loaders are highly
mobile machines that can traverse a wide
variety of terrain, and can use their grapple
to help stabilize the machine on steep or
difficult ground (MacDonald 1999).
The timber extraction routes/trails
(Figure 4) are described as a modified upand-down pattern. Up-and-down and

serpentine working patterns have been used
successfully where the forwarding distance
and terrain permit (Andersson and Jukes
1995; Phillips 1996). There was no attempt
to forward the stems using a serpentine pattern
during this study. Machine travel within the
cutblocks was typically perpendicular to the
contours, except when ground obstacles such
as large boulders, or steep terrain features such
as ridges, altered direction of travel. Trees were
felled parallel to the contours, as for a cable
yarding operation.
Loader-forwarding trails were travelled
on more than once. The loaders first roughbunched and windrowed the stems while
forwarding them a short distance. When a
continuous length of windrowed stems was
prepared, the loaders forwarded these stems
to roadside and then prepared the next wood
further along the travel route. This resulted
4

in more machine travel closer to the haul road
than at the back of the cutblock. Preparing
and forwarding the stems into windrowed
bunches was more time consuming than
forwarding the prepared windrows.
When forwarding the windrowed stems,
the loaders were positioned between the
stems and the road, 10 m (i.e., full reach)
from the stems. This allowed the machines
to forward the maximum distance each time
they handled the stems. The loaders grappled
up to 7 logs at one time (average 3 to 4), and
forwarded them approximately 20 m per pass
(Figure 5). Limbs were often knocked off
during the multiple handling, leaving a
random brush mat within the cutblock. As
well, limbs were removed by holding a stem
loosely in the grapple and sliding the grapple
along the length of the stem.

The streams within the cutblocks were
identified on field maps. One stream in
Cutblock 21 and one in Cutblock 13 were
buffered. Small-diameter (i.e., less than 17.5 cm
dbh) co-dominant trees, saplings, and advanced
regeneration were retained within the riparian
management zones to provide streambank
stability. Within Cutblock 21, the loaders
built a corduroy trail of logs before crossing
the in-block stream, and dismantled it after
use. The loaders extracted felled trees from
within the riparian buffers with minimal
damage to the residual trees (Figure 6).
Loader-forwarders can work safely around
riparian zones without affecting the actual
watercourse (MacDonald 1999).
Cutblocks 21 and 24 had favourable
forwarding conditions with slopes up to
39% and 41%, respectively. Cutblock 13
contained both adverse and favourable
forwarding conditions, with adverse pitches
reaching 33% and favourable pitches
reaching 39%. On occasion, the smaller and
lighter Kobelco SK 220-LC was utilized on
the steeper pitches, as the larger machines
tended to slip downhill while maneuvering
to reach these areas.
Boulders up to 2.8 m in diameter were
present throughout all three cutblocks, and
hindered machine travel (Figure 7). Angular
colluvium was beneath and near the surface
of the cutblocks. The combination of
continued track movement, maneuvering
around boulders, and the summer heat (up
to 35°C) caused the machines to overheat or
become very close to overheating. When this
occurred, the operator stopped to allow the
machine to cool down and left the engine
either idling or turned off completely.

Study methods
The shift-level data were collected daily
from the three loaders and were used to
obtain total scheduled machine hours (SMH)
for the forwarding and loading phases.
Harvest volumes were supplied by
Ainsworth and presented with SMH to show
productivities. The loader-forwarding and
loading times were combined during the

shift-level data collection. Therefore,
productivity calculations include both
loader-forwarding and loading.
Loader-forwarding cycles were detail-timed
throughout the study, and included samples
from all three cutblocks representing both
adverse and favourable forwarding (see
Appendix I for definitions of timing elements).
Factors affecting the performance of the
loader-forwarding were recorded.
Timber extraction and loading
productivities were generated using shift-level
and detailed-timing study methods. The
hourly machine costs were calculated using
FERIC’s standard machine costing method
(Appendix II) and were used to generate a
cost per harvested volume.

Following harvesting, the three cutblocks
were surveyed to estimate the proportion of
site occupied by the loader-forwarding trails.
A randomly oriented grid was superimposed
over the entire loader-forwarding area of the
three study sites. Grids 35 m by 35 m were used
on Cutblocks 21 and 24, and 50 m by 50 m
on Cutblock 13. At each plot centre, two
perpendicular random line transects were
established, and ground characteristics were
tallied. Data were summarized as a percentage
of total harvested area for each cutblock.
The survey collected data for undisturbed
and harvest-generated surface conditions.
Harvesting disturbance included primary and
secondary loader-forwarding trails, corduroy
or stem mat trails, and gouges. The primary
and secondary trails were further classified as
being compressed slash, mixed organic, exposed
mineral, or exposed colluvium. Primary and
secondary loader-forwarding trails are
described by the following attributes:
• Primary trail: Evidence of numerous
machine passes. Travel paths for both
machine tracks are continuous and easily

followed for at least 4 m from the
transect sample area, with obvious track
impressions and a mound between the
two track locations. These trails would
have had an estimated 6 to 15 passes
and were often located within 50 to
75 m of the haul road and decking area
(Figure 8).
• Secondary trail: Less heavily travelled
extensions of the primary trails, and not
always obvious if observed independent
of the approaching track path. Only one
track path may be present, and the
mound between track travel paths may
not be evident. These trails would have
had an estimated 1 to 5 passes, and were
often located toward the back of the
cutblock as compared to the front.

Results and discussion
Shift-level study

Table 2 summarizes the shift-level results
by machine and cutblock. Cutblock 21
was harvested first followed by Cutblocks
24 and 13. The average shift length at
Cutblocks 21 and 13 was approximately 9 h,
whereas at Cutblock 24 the average shift
length was approximately 10 h. Mechanical
and non-mechanical delays increased as the
study progressed.
The harsh environment (boulders) and
resulting wear on the undercarriage caused
extended delays, especially within Cutblock
13 where Kobelco SK 300-LC #1 and #2

waited a total of 14 shifts for undercarriage
and turntable parts. These 14 shifts were not
included in scheduled machine time.
The productive machine time is generated
from the scheduled machine time less
mechanical, non-mechanical, servicing, and
other downtime (including meals). Delays
greater than 15 minutes were recorded within
the shift-level data. Availability and utilization
decreased as the harvesting progressed.2
Table 3 shows the productivites for all three
machines working together to complete the
combined phases of loader-forwarding,
processing and loading in the loaderforwarding system. The production per
SMH was highest for Cutblock 21 (first
harvested), and lowest for Cutblock 24.
Production per PMH was highest for the
last cutblock harvested. The loader-forwarding
technique likely improved over time and
Cutblock 13 had a larger piece size and higher
volume per hectare. Using an average shift
length of 9.2 h for all three cutblocks
gives an average productivity of 265 m3/
loader-forwarding system shift.
The process of the three loaders loaderforwarding the stems to roadside, the landing
bucker processing the stems, and the haul
trucks being loaded cost an average of
$15.20/m3.

for “all 3 machines” are weighted averages.
These are heavily influenced by Kobelco
SK 300-LC #2 which had 22 h of the 26 h
total timing samples. The swing empty
cycle element was consistently the shortest
of all the elements.
On average, for every 5.6 times a machine
handled wood and swung empty, the machine
moved, and for approximately every five
moves there was a delay. Using the calculated
ratios, an average time of 5.1 minutes was
required to move 20 logs a distance of 20 m,
including a delay of 1 minute.
Figure 9 shows the proportion of time
each machine spent within the detailed-timing
cycle elements. On average, the machines
spent four-fifths of the time performing a
productive function (move, swing empty, or
handle wood), and the remaining time in
delays.
Soil disturbance

Cutblock 13 had proportionately the least
amount of total trail area at 9.3%, and
Cutblock 21 had the most at 11.3% (Table 5).
In this study, the more heavily used primary
trails occupied less area than the secondary
trails. The primary trail occupied up to a

quarter of the total trail area by cutblock.
Undisturbed portions of the cutblocks
accounted for 89 to 91% of the cutblock
area. By comparison, Kosicki (2001) reported
that 20.4% of a tandem loader-forwarding
and clambunk skidding harvested cutblock
was occupied by trails.

classification. Within the continuous
impressions of the primary trails, exposed
mineral soil was not prevalent, but there was
usually a mat of compressed slash. The
operators were careful not to spin the machine
tracks, and therefore minimized the churning
of the soil.
Although the survey was not done to
measure compliance with the Forest Practices
Code (FPC), the primary trails can be
considered 100% disturbed by FPC
definition (either dispersed trail: wheel/track
rut or dispersed trail: repeated machine
traffic [BCMOF and BC Environment
2001a, 2001b]). About one-third of the
secondary trails would correspond to the
dispersed trail: repeated machine traffic
disturbance. This equates to 4–5% total soil
disturbance for each cutblock. All three
cutblocks are within the maximum acceptable
disturbance levels specified in their silviculture
prescriptions.
The entrance and exit locations of the
cutblocks were utilized and travelled over
many times, and were subject to soil churning
and scalping. The loader operators were
careful to reduce this disturbance by using
their grapples to assist the machines’ movement
while carefully engaging the tracks.

Conclusions
Operators that had no experience with
loader-forwarding were able to forward treelength stems to roadside using 25- and
33-tonne loaders, within areas of a clearcut
block designed for cable yarding, at a cost of
$15.20/m3 which included processing and
loading. The loaders forwarded the stems for
a maximum distance of 155–205 m, on slopes
up to 41% favourable and 33% adverse.
Productivity averaged 265 m3/average loaderforwarding system shift (three machines harvesting three cutblocks including processing
and loading). Loader-forwarding was new to
the crew and some time was required to learn
the technique.

cutblock, and declined to 93% in the last
cutblock. Utilization averaged 92% in the
first harvested cutblock, and also declined in
the last cutblock, to 84%. Detailed timing
showed delays accounted for nearly one-fifth
of the productive machine time.
The bouldery conditions were thought
to have caused one of the machines to lose
its track and initiate the extended waitfor-part delay. Undercarriage repairs and
delays may occur more frequently during
loader-forwarding operations than compared
to typical loading duties.
Results of the soil disturbance survey
showed that loader-forwarding trails occupied
9–11% of the cutblock area, and when
extrapolated to FPC standards for soil
disturbance, the three cutblocks were all
within their stated acceptable limits.

Implementation
During the study, FERIC identified
conditions for successful and efficient use of
loader-forwarding operations:
• Thirty-five-tonne loaders can forward
stems within clearcut blocks with slopes
up to 41% favourable and 33% adverse.
These slopes may be close to the limits
for this size of machine. The 25-tonne
loader was able to negotiate the 41%
favourable slope slightly easier than the
larger machines.
• Using a feller-buncher to fall and bunch
the harvested stems may be beneficial
with respect to productivity. The loaders
spent more time preparing and forwarding
the stems into windrowed bunches than
forwarding the prepared bunches.
• Terrain with large or numerous boulders
should be noted when field layout is
done. Split lines can divide areas between
those compatible with loader-forwarding
and those for cable yarding. The boulders
encountered during this study were hard
on the machines and were thought to
be a main source of the gradual decline
in availability and utilization.

• Locations where the machines enter and
exit the cutblocks are vulnerable to site
disturbance. The best locations to enter
and/or exit the cutblock may be identified during planning and marked after
road construction. Protective matting,
chunks of wood, or corduroyed stems
may also lessen the impact at these locations.

Cycle elements for detailed timing of
loader-forwarding operation
Handle wood:

Begins when “swing empty” is finished and grapple is used to grasp logs
to be forwarded, and ends when grapple releases log(s). Includes bunching
and double handling to make neat windrowed decks within the cutblock,
re-handling dropped pick-ups, positioning grapple after swing empty
stops, aborted handles, and handling wood while moving.

Swing empty:

Begins when “handle wood” or “move” stops. Typically occurs after each
handling of a forwarded grapple of stems. There is no track movement
during “swing empty”. Includes turning machine 360° to look for
appropriate placement of machine.

Move:

Begins when tracks are engaged and the loader travels or re-positions
itself (with an empty grapple). Includes moving obstacles in the path of
machine travel, pushing heel of grapple into the ground to lift and twist
the tracks, and preparing travel path over streams and boulders by
placing logs as corduroy trails or lift logs.

Delay:

Begins when a productive element is interrupted and ends when a
productive element is recommenced. Includes mechanical and personnel
delays.

These costs are based on FERIC’s standard costing methodology for determining machine ownership and operating
costs, and do not include such costs as crew transportation, supervision, profit, and office overhead. IWA labour rates
effective June 15/99 have been used. Note: Costs per hour for the landing bucker are calculated using IWA labour rates,
38% wage beneifit loading, and $18/day saw allowance, equalling $35.13.
