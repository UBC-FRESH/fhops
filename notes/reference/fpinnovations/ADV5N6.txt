Using mechanized systems to harvest
second-growth forests in coastal British
Columbia: productivity and costs of a
processing operation
Abstract

The Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada (FERIC) monitored the processing phase of a clearcut harvesting operation on Vancouver Island. This report is part of
FERIC’s overall study on the operational and economic feasibility of using mechanized
systems for clearcut harvesting of coastal second-growth stands on steep slopes. Two
previous reports presented the results of the felling and extraction phases.

Introduction
As forest companies in coastal British
Columbia harvest more second-growth
stands, opportunities to use mechanized harvesting systems often arise. Feller-bunchers,
processors, loader-forwarders, and skidders—
if used appropriately—offer opportunities to
reduce harvesting costs with acceptable site
impacts. At the request of its members,
FERIC has been investigating the use of this
equipment in coastal second-growth stands.
In the spring of 2002, TimberWest Forest
Corp.’s. Cowichan Woodlands Operation
and Honeymoon Bay Operation undertook
a series of trials to investigate the feasibility
of using mechanized systems for clearcut
harvesting on steep slopes. FERIC monitored
the trials to determine the operational and
economic feasibility of these systems. Because
of the scope of this study, the results are
presented in several “Advantage” reports. Two
previous reports presented the results for
the mechanized felling and extraction

operations (Kosicki and Dyson 2003, 2004).
This report presents the results for the
processing phase.

Objectives
The primary goal of this study was to
assess the economic and operational feasibility of using mechanized systems for clearcut
harvesting on steep slopes. The objectives of
this report on the processing phase were to:
• Determine overall productivities and
costs for roadside processing.
• Evaluate processors as components of
roadside harvesting systems.
• Compare results of hot and cold
processing options.1

1

In a “hot processing” system, extraction and processing
phases occur simultaneously, and the supply buffer
between these phases is generally small. In a “cold
processing” system, processing usually starts after the
extraction phase has been completed, and the supply
buffer between both phases is generally large.

Harvesting systems

Study methods

An overview of harvesting systems and
equipment used in this project is shown in
Table 1. Both manual and mechanized
felling with feller-bunchers were used.
Depending on block layout and terrain,
stems were extracted with loader-forwarders
or swing yarders. At roadside, the stems were
decked for hot or cold processing by danglehead processors.

Description of sites and
stands for processing
operation
Processing operations were observed on
three study blocks (Blocks B, C, and D).
Descriptions of these blocks are given in
Kosicki and Dyson (2003, 2004).

FERIC observed the processing operation
and collected shift-level and detailed-timing
data. Shift-level data for the processing phase
were collected in study blocks B, C, and D,
and consisted of datalogger charts and
operators’ reports about daily production
and major delays (>15 min/occurrence).
Processing cycles were detail-timed at frequent
intervals throughout the study period. In
Block B, the detailed-timing study focused
on cold processing of loader-forwarded
stems, and in Blocks C and D on hot
processing of grapple yarded stems. Net
volumes were obtained from TimberWest’s
scale records. Hourly processor costs were
calculated using FERIC’s standard costing
methods (Appendix I).

Overview of processing
operations

Processing operations in the study blocks
were performed from mid-May to late July
2002. In all study blocks, roadside processing
of loader-forwarded and/or grapple yarded
stems was done with Waratah HTH624
processor heads (Figure 1) mounted on
Madill 3800 carriers. Table 2 presents the
technical specifications for these machines.
Depending on block layout and decking
conditions, cold and/or hot processing
systems were used (Table 3). The processors
were operated by TimberWest crews and
scheduled to work five days per week on a
double-shift (Blocks B and C) or single-shift
basis (Block D).
Shift-level study

The shift-level study was based on shifts
with complete records (scheduled and
productive machine hours, volume processed,
etc.). Shifts with incomplete records were
excluded from evaluation.
In Block B, only cold processing of
loader-forwarded and grapple yarded stems
was done. The shift-level study was based
on records for 26 productive shifts, or 197 h.
Table 3 summarizes shift structure, productivity in cubic metres per productive machine
hour (m3/PMH) and scheduled machine
hour (m3/SMH), and cost in $/m3.
Shift lengths ranged from 6.3 to 8.3 h
and averaged 7.6 h. For the monitoring
period, availability and utilization were 94
and 88%, respectively. Almost all mechanical
delays were caused by problems related to
hydraulic components.
The total volume processed in Block B
during the monitoring period was 9531 m3.
For single shifts, the processing productivity
of loader-forwarded stems varied from 45
to 79 m³/PMH and averaged 56 m³/PMH.
Because of more difficult handling of
grapple yarded stems decked below the
road, processing of grapple yarded stems was
less productive. For single shifts, it varied

52 m³/PMH. For a utilization rate of 88%,
these average productivities translated into
49 and 46 m³/SMH for the loader-forwarded

The overall processing productivity of

in Block B was 55 m³/PMH and 48 m³/SMH,

of loader-forwarded stems was slightly less
expensive than processing of grapple yarded
stems ($2.86/m³ and $3.05/m³, respectively).
In Block C, because of limited decking
area, only hot processing of uphill yarded
stems was done (Figure 2). A small number

area was cold processed during longer
breaks in yarding activities (e.g., moving and
repairing the yarder). All processed stems
were decked for hot loading. The results for
nine shifts with a full set of processing records
are shown in Table 3.
Shift lengths ranged from 5.5 to 8.5 h
and averaged 8.2 h. The total volume
processed during the monitoring period was
3 521 m3. The overall processing productivity was 56 stems and 56 m3 per PMH.
For a utilization rate of 85%, this translates
into 47 stems and 48 m3 per SMH. Several
4

factors contributed to this relatively high
processing productivity. The most important
factor was a good balance between number
of stems in yarded cycle loads and the
processor’s production capabilities. Yarded
stems were processed immediately, usually
before the next yarded load arrived at the
roadside. This prevented accumulation of
stems and facilitated grappling of the stems
for processing. Another important factor
was that the processed logs could be placed
directly on the road for hot loading instead
of being decked beside or below the road. A
supply of cold decked stems nearby allowed
the processor to continue working during
yarder downtime and maintain high overall
productivity. A final contributing factor
was the large volume of 1.01 m³/stem. For an
hourly rate of $140.37/SMH (Appendix I), the
processing cost in Block C was $2.92/m3.
In Block D, the stems were grapple
yarded downhill and decked. The majority
of the stems was cold processed and only a
small number of stems was hot processed.

shift-level productivities of 69 m³/PMH
determined for shifts on which the detailed
timing was conducted.
In Block C, the average processing
time of 1.04 min/stem included 0.16 min
of interaction time between the swing yarder
and processor. For an average volume of
1.01 m3/stem, the processing productivity
of 58 m 3/PMH in this detailed-timing
study was almost identical with the productivity of 56 m3/PMH in the shift-level study
(Table 2).
In Block D, the average processing time
was 1.16 min/stem. For an average volume
of 0.44 m3/stem, the productivity of hot
processing was 21 m3/PMH. This productivity
was much less than the average productivity
of 38 m³/PMH based on the shift-level study
that was done primarily in a cold processing
system.

The results for seven shifts are shown in
Table 3. The total volume processed during
these shifts was 1 723 m3. The processor
achieved very high productivity in numbers
of stems per hour (87 stems/PMH and
64 stems/SMH), but because of a very low
average volume of 0.44 m3/stem, the average
processing productivity of 38 m3/PMH
(28 m3/SMH) was well below productivities
achieved in Blocks B and C. For an hourly
machine rate of $140.37/SMH (Appendix I),
the processing cost was $5.01/m3.
Detailed-timing study

The detailed timing was performed on
cold processing of loader-forwarded stems in
Block B, and on hot processing of grapple
yarded stems in Blocks C and D. The results
of these studies are summarized in Table 4.
The lowest average processing time
(0.79 min/stem) and the highest productivity (72 m 3/PMH) were recorded in
Block B. This high productivity can be
attributed to the cold processing of loaderforwarded stems piled in long decks easily
accessible to the processor. The productivity
of 72 m³/PMH agreed well with the average

Conclusions
The results of the processing study
suggest that a Waratah HTH624 dangle
head processor on a Madill 3800 carrier is a
suitable processing combination for roadside
harvesting in second-growth forests in coastal

British Columbia. This combination can
effectively process loader-forwarded and
grapple yarded stems in both cold and hot
processing systems.
The greatest processing productivity
may be expected when processing loaderforwarded stems decked in continuous
windrows with an easy access from the road
and sufficient room for decking processed
logs. For the working conditions observed
in Block B, this yielded productivities of
56 m3/PMH. For cold processing of grapple
yarded stems, processing productivity was less,
averaging 52 m³/PMH. For processing of
loader-forwarded and grapple yarded stems,
the average productivity was 48 m3/SMH
at a cost of $2.92/m3.
In Block C, where a hot processing
system was used for grapple-yarded stems,
the processing productivity was 48 m3/SMH
at a cost of $2.92/m3. These results are
identical to those for the cold processing
system in Block B, and suggest that the hot
processing system can be efficient even if
unavoidable delays result from interaction
between the yarder and processor.
The lowest average productivity of
28 m3/SMH for hot and cold processing
combined was recorded in Block D. Although
the processing productivity in number of
stems per scheduled machine hour was the
highest in the three study blocks, the small
average volume of 0.44 m3/stem means the
hourly productivity was 28 m³/SMH. At an
hourly machine cost of $140.37/SMH
(Appendix I), the processing cost in Block D
was $5.01/m3.

Implementation
During the observed processing operation,
FERIC identified conditions for successful
and effective use of the Waratah HTH624
processor head on the Madill 3800 carrier:
• If the haul road system and terrain
permit unobstructed and safe decking
of loader-forwarded and/or grapple
yarded stems, a cold processing system is
advantageous. It will eliminate interaction
between the extraction and processing
phases and will allow all machines to
maximize their productivities.
• Hot processing of grapple yarded stems
is operationally feasible and, under certain
conditions, may be highly productive.
However, because yarding productivity
varies with distance and other factors
while processing productivity is relatively
stable, production losses in processing
are unavoidable and hot processing
systems should be used only when
necessary (e.g., limited decking area for
yarded stems, safety requirements, need
to minimize the duration of the total
harvesting time).
• If a hot processing system is used, try to
minimize potential production losses in
the processing phase by having a supply
of cold-decked stems nearby for the
processor to work on if the yarder is idle.
