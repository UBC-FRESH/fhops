                      Forest Products Ltd.’s (Canfor) Mackenzie           • Determine processing productivity in
                      Operations, used a short-wood harvest                 summer conditions.
                      system on steep terrain consisting of loaders,      • Determine the effects of site and stand
                      processors, and a swing yarder.                       factors on processing productivity.
                           After the winter study was completed           • Compare processing productivity in
                      (Boswell 2004), Canfor asked FERIC to                 summer and winter.

 a
   These costs are estimated using FERIC’s standard costing methodology for determining machine ownership and operating costs for
   new machines. The costs shown here do not include supervision, travel time, profit or overhead and are not the actual costs for the
   contractor.
 b
   Costs for carriers were calculated using generic machines for each class size.
 c
   Based on quote from Waratah Distribution for a HTH 622B harvesting head. The HTH 620 harvesting head is no longer manufactured.
 d
   Based on a quote from Waratah Distribution for a HTH 624 Super harvesting head.
 e
   Based on quote from IMAC Attachments.
 f
   Diesel fuel unit price as per a quote from The National Industrial Transport Log for June 2004.
 g
   Although the loaders spent a substantial amount of time travelling back and forth between the processor and the log decks, and
   therefore undercarriage wear would be higher than in stationary applications, this was not accounted for in the costing.
 h
   Wage rates are as per 2004 rates outlined in the IWA Southern Interior Master Agreement.
 i
   Prorated overtime rates are as per 2004 rates in the IWA Southern Interior Master Agreement and reflect time and one-half for all shift
   hours in excess of 8 hours but not exceeding 11 hours. Double time was allotted for all shift hours worked in excess of 11 hours.
