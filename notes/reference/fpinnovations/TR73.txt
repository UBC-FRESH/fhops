SUMMARY

The objective of this study was to monitor and evaluate the productivity and costs of falling , skidding , yarding, processing, and loading as a
result of:
-

full-tree grapple yarding with roadside processing;
bunch skidding with landing processing; and
bunch grapple-yarding with roadside processing.

The study block was located approximately 5 km west of Buckley Bay ,
B.C. Stand composition was mainly second-growth Douglas-fir , with lesser
amounts of hemlock and cedar. T o facilitate studying the different systems,
the 34-ha study block was divided into three areas.
The logging system found to be most efficient and cost-effective was
bunch skidding with landing processing , combined with close supervision. On a
cost-per-piece basis, this system was 1 3% cheaper than the other systems
studied.
The other two systems were full-tree grapple yarding and bunch
grapple yarding. Yarding of bunches reduced the cost per piece by over $1 .50.
Production increased more than 65% on a pieces-per-shift basis.
The side-by-side system comparisons resulted in a number of other
findings. First , grapple design and size is critical to yarding productivity.
For example, there was a 42% improvement in productivity when a different
grapple was introduced into the handfelled area.
Second , falling patterns and methods play a decisive role in
skidding , yarding, and roadside processing productivities. For instance ,
yarding the handfelled area resulted in tree tops facing the road when
windrowed. This reduced processing productivity.
Third, there was a noticeable reduction in logging residue left on
the site in the bunched-wood areas.
Fourth , roadside processing offered the extra advantage of allowing
presorting in the woods. This saved dollars o n those pieces which bypassed
the dryland sortyard processing phases.
One of the major problems still existing in coastal B.C. is the
inability to remove full-tree wood efficiently from windrows for roadside
processing. This must be solved in order to make roadside processing more
cost effective in the future and permit the full gains of mechanization to be
achieved.

SOMMAIRE

L'objectif de cette étude fut d'enregistrer et d'évaluer l a productivité et les coûts d'abattage, de débusquage, de téléphérage , de transformation et de chargement résultant du:
-

téléphérage à grappins d'arbres entiers avec transformation au chemin;
débusquage par ballot avec transformation à la jetée; et du
téléphérage à grappins par ballot avec transformation au chemin.

La zone étudiée était située à approximativement 5 km à l'ouest de
Buckley Bay , C.B. Le peuplement était composé principalement de sapin de
Douglas de second pousse , avec une moindre quantité de pruche et de cèdre.
Afin de faciliter 1'étude des différents systèmes , les 34 ha de la zone
d'étude furent divisés en trois parties.
Le système d'exploitation qui s'est avéré le plus efficace avec les
coûts les plus avantageux fut le débusquage par ballot avec transformation à
la jetée, en combinaison avec une étroite surveillance. Sur une base de coûtpar-morceau , ce système était 13% moins cher que les autres systèmes étudiés.
Les deux autres systèmes étaient le téléphérage à grappins d'arbres
entiers et le téléphérage à grappins par ballot. Le téléphérage de ballots a
réduit le coût par morceau de plus de $1 .50. La productivité fut augmentée de
plus de 65% sur une base de morceau- par-quart de travail.
D e nombreuses constatations résultèrent des comparaisons côte-à-côte
des systèmes. Premièrement , la conception et les dimensions du grappin sont
d'une importance majeure quant à la productivité par téléphérage. Par exemple,
la productivité s'est accrue de 42% lorsqu'un grappin différent fut introduit
dans l a zone d'abattage manuel.
Deuxièmement, les méthodes et les modes d'abattage ont joué un rôle
décisif dans la productivité du débusquage, de téléphérage et de transformation en bordure de chemin. En effet, le téléphérage des zones abattues manuelle'
ment, avec l e mode en rangées au bordure de route , donnait lieu à des cîmes
d'arbres face au chemin. Ceci réduisit l a productivité de la transformation.
Troisièmement , il y eu une diminution importante de résidus de coupe
sur les sites ou les arbres étaient assemblés par ballots.
Quatrièmement , l a transformation en bordure de chemin offrit un
avantage supplémentaire en permettant un triage préliminaire en forêt. Ceci
occasionna des économies de coûts pour les billes évitant la voie du parc de
triage pour les phases de transformation.
Un des problèmes majeurs toujours persistant sur les côtes de l a
C.B. est l'incapacité de sortir efficacement les arbres entiers abattus en
rangées au bordure de route, pour ensuite être transformés en bordure de
chemin. Ce problème doit être solutionné afin de rendre l a transformation en
bordure de chemin plus rentable dans le futur et d'atteindre tous les bénéfices de l a mécanisation.

INTRODUCTION
The objective of this study was to compare the cost, productivity,
and operational factors of three different harvesting systems in a B.C.
coastal second-growth stand.
MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.'s Northwest Bay Division has been logging
second-growth stands for several years. To increase profitability , fellerbunchers, skidders, and mechanical processors have been used to log these
lower-value stands. However , it was recognized that ground-skidding systems
are limited on the coast of B.C. because of site disturbance and mountainous
terrain. Since the division also had experienced cable-yarding crews and
equipment available, there was int erest in determining if conventional cablelogging systems could be modified to harvest second-growth stands economically
in some areas. In 1985, a decision was made to harvest a second-growth stand
on a test basis to determine the advantages and disadvantages of partially
mechanizing a cable-logging system. FERIC was asked to monitor and evaluate
the test. This report gives the results of the evaluation.
FERIC also used this project to begin collecting detailed information on how productivity and cost are affected by tree size, terrain, distance , and other factors for the Harvesting Economics Project.
The objective of the Harvesting Economics Project is to provide
industry with a method to estimate more accurately the marginal costs of
harvesting logs to determine economic utilization standards for various
logging areas. The yarding and falling phases were examined intensively
during this study. The results of the examination will be reported in more
detail in subsequent reports.
STUDY METHOD
The study was conducted at MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.'s Northwest Bay
Division o n the east coast of Vancouver Island. Falling started in April 1985
and logging was completed in October 1985. The study area was a 34-ha opening
in a 1 10-year-old second-growth stand. The area was divided into three parts
and a different system was used in each. The systems were:
System 1 - Mechanically fall and bunch
- Grapple yard to roadside and windrow
- Process at roadside fr om windrow
- Load
System 2 - Handfall with selective bucking
- Grapple yard to roadside and windrow
- Process at roadside from windrow
- Load

1

System 3 ~ Mechanically fall and bunch
- Ground skid to landing
- Process in landing
- Load
In Systems 1 and 2, yarding preceded processing but in System 3, skidding and
processing were concurrent.
Prior divisional experience had shown that processing in a landing
in conjunction with skidding was productive and cost-effective. However , the
division had less experience in processing at roadside from windrowed logs.
Consequently , it was decided to try a variety of roadside processing methods
with Systems 1 and 2 to determine their cost and productivity. The roadside
processing systems tested were:
-

Hahn Harvester
Hahn Harvester II
Log loader and hand buckers

All production data were obtained by FERIC personnel using timing
boards and stopwatches. The company supplied stand and log-volume information
and conducted the waste-assessment survey after logging.
The timing results , in which all mechanical and operational delays
were recorded, were converted to an 8-hour-shift basis (6.5 hours in the case
of the handfallers) to determine productivity. Delay time includes all
delays, both major and minor. The utilization levels used were those observed
during detailed timing. However , when making comparisons between the same
machine used in different systems , a standard utilization level was used.
The labour rates used in the cost analysis are current IWA rates
plus 35% burden (Appendix I ). Machinery costs are FERIC estimates based on
information from equipment distributors and a standard owning , repairing, and
operating formula is used. Unless stated , costs such as supervision, overhead , and crew and equipment transportation are not included. Interest or
opportunity costs are excluded from the machinery costs reported in the text,
but are listed in Appendix I.

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA
Forest cover maps show the establishment date of the present stand
as 1874, following the blow down of the previous stand. Most remaining oldgrowth timber was logged in the late 1940s. A few old-growth trees and some
sound , cedar windfalls were scattered’throughout the present stand.
Terrain was rolling and sloped to the east. Slopes varied from 0 to
52%, with an average of 17-5 percent. (More detail on the terrain can be
found in Appendices II and III.) The only obstacles were old-growth stumps
and windfalls. Understory was mainly sword fern and Oregon grape with some
small salai patches in the northwest corner of the block.

Site index of the stand was 24 (BASE 50) and stocking was 89
percent. Stand information was derived from MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.’s forest
cover maps and local knowledge. Appendix IV gives area and volume information
on the trial site.

System 1

Trees were mechanically felled and bunched by a Case 1 18? fellerbuncher equipped with a 50-cm Drott shear head. Trees were laid in bunches at
approximately a 45° angle to the yarding road to improve yarding efficiency.
Trees with a butt diameter greater than 50 cm were handfelled and those under
a 60-cm butt diameter were left full-tree. The bottom one or two logs were
hand bucked from trees with more than a 60-cm butt diameter and the remainder
of the tree was left for roadside processing. Ninety-seven percent of the
trees ( 87% of the total volume) were within the cutting capacity of the Case
1 18? feller-buncher.
Terrain in the System 1 area was suited for mechanical falling.
Slope ranged from 0 to 38%, with an average of 18% and there were f ew obstacles to travel. The Case 1 187 feller-buncher was able to traverse the entire
area.
Table 1 is a summary of the detailed timing study on the Case 1 187
feller-buncher. The machine spent 77% of its time o n productive functions.
The majority of maintenance time was for hydraulic hose repair , general
servicing , and track repairs.

A butt-damage evaluation on mechanically felled trees was carried
out by FERIC (see Guimier 1981 and McMorland 1985 for method). Based on all
trees measured in the bunch-turn yarding area, the average loss was 1.89
percent. The estimated mill loss, assuming all logs were cut into 2 x 6s,
would be 2.54 percent.
From the operational cruise data , the handfaller felled 3% of the
stems (13% of the total volume). In addition, he felled snags and a few trees
that were inaccessible to the feller-buncher and hand bucked some large windfalls. Table 3 gives the productivity and cost summary for the handfaller.

When working directly with the feller-buncher , the handfaller
experienced long delays while waiting for the machine to get into the clear.
As a result , the faller would wait until the machine had felled a sizeable
area and then he would fall the remaining standing trees. In addition to
reducing delays, this freed the faller for more productive work in other
cutting areas.
Table 4 shows the combined falling costs for System 1.

System 2

All trees were handfelled perpendicular to the yarding road to
improve yarding efficiency (Figure B). Trees under 6〇-cm butt diameter were
left as full trees. Selective bucking was done on those over 6 0 cm, e.g., the
bottom one or two logs were hand bucked and the remainder left for roadside
processing. Only 3% of the trees required hand bucking.

each shift and at lunch time. Delay time will normally be greater than shown

System 3

Trees under 5 0 cm were mechanically f elled and bunched by a Drott 50
feller-buncher equipped with a 50-cm Drott shear head (Figure C ). Throughout
the study period the machine operated o n a single-shift basis. Trees with a
butt diameter greater than 5 0 cm were handfelled and those under a 6〇-cm butt
diameter were left full-tree. The bottom one or two logs were hand bucked
from trees with more than a 6〇-cm butt diameter and the remainder left for
roadside processing .

FIGURE C.

Drott 5 0 Feller-Buncher.

Terrain in the System 3 area was suited for mechanical falling.
Slope ranged from 0 to 19%, with an average of 1 2 percent. The Drott 5 0
feller-buncher had little difficulty traversing the area.
There were many windfalls and a higher percentage of large stems in
this area than in the other areas. This necessitated a handfaller working
with the feller-buncher almost full time. Thirteen percent of the trees (45%

8

of the total volume) required handfalling and bucking. This reduced the
efficiency of the feller-buncher as it had to work around these large trees.
Bunches were laid with the butts facing the landing to achieve
maximum skidding efficiency.
Detailed timing data for the Drott 50 feller-buncher are shown in
Table 7 and are based on approximately 55 hours of detailed timing information. Table 8 is a summary of productivity and cost for the Drott 50 fellerbuncher.

Based o n all trees measured , the average wood loss as a result of
butt damage was 1 .34 percent. Estimated mill loss, assuming all logs were cut
into 2 x 6 s , would be 1.92 percent.
Handfalling was done o n 13% of the stems, which accounted for 45% of
the total volume. The faller experienced long delays while waiting for the
feller-buncher to get in the clear. H e also felled snags and trees that were
inaccessible t o the feller-buncher , and bucked windfalls. Production data for
handfalling are shown in Table 9 . Costs per cubic metre and per tree include
a faller and saw at 50% utilization.

System Comparison- -Falling

The high capital costs of the feller-bunchers make them the higher
cost method (Table 11). The number of trees felled per shift for the two
machines studied were about the same. The difference in cost per cubic metre
between the two machines is mainly because of piece size variance. The
average tree volume for the Case 1 18 7 was 0.54 m 3 versus 0.70 m 3 for the
Drott 50. O n a long-term basis, handfalling costs will be higher than shown
because delays such a s high-wind days and safety meetings are not included.

System 1 (Mechanically Felled)

Yarding was done by a 1982 Madill 084 grapple yarder using a 1978
Hitachi UHT4 mobile backspar (Figure E). Pieces were yarded to roadside and
decked in Windrows. Yarding deflection was generally good , with a maximum
yarding distance of 1 45 m. The bunching pattern resulted in good operator
visibility and opportunity for the grapple to yard multiple pieces per turn.
Bunching also resulted in all tree butts facing the road. This increased the
efficiency of roadside processing.

System 2 (Handfelled)

Yarding was done by the same crew and backspar as in System 1.
Pieces were yarded to roadside and decked in windrows.
Yarding deflection was generally good except for one section in the
northwest corner of the block. The placement of the spur road created a
situation where the yarder operator could not see many of the pieces he was
hooking up. He was aided by the hooker giving directions by radio. Compared
to the prior day, hookup time increased by 22% during the 2.5-hour period he
yarded this area.

The falling pattern, with trees perpendicular to the yarding road,
allowed the operator good opportunity to grab the trees. Some disadvantages
were:
-

Tops lay both ways. To facilitate roadside processing , it is preferable
to have all butts facing the road. This falling pattern does not make
for efficient butt-first yarding.

-

If more than one piece was grappled , then quite often a piece would not
stay in lead. This caused more hangups, more strain on the grapple, and
longer decking time.

Right-of-way logs were not picked up and loaded prior to yarding.
This reduced yarder productivity as many of these pieces had to be pulled away
from the road and aligned for windrowing.
C.

Grapple Yarding--Grapple Comparison

Two different yarding grapples (Table 16 ) were used in the System 1
area. The use of the larger Johnson Y 106 grapple resulted in a 20% increase
in the number of pieces yarded per Productive Machine Hour (PMH)• This
increase results from the size and design differences of the two grapples
(Appendices V and VI).

in System 1 , the use of the larger Johnson 1106 grapple resulted in increased
productivity . It was 23% more productive than the Y96 grapple and 75% more
productive than the Mantle 6 5 yarding grapple.
D.

System 3 (Mechanically Felled )

All pieces were skidded by choker or grapple skidders. They were
landed either at the Hahn Harvester for immediate processing or were decked
for later forwarding to the Hahn. Bucked , oversize logs were skidded directly
t o the Barko 250 log loader f or sorting and loading.

Clarke 667 Grapple Skidder.

The bunched wood provided excellent hookup opportunity for the
skidders. The fall ing pattern , wi th the butts f acing the landing , decreased
the amount of breakage that woul d otherwise happen when pulling trees into lead .
Three to four skidders were used daily in this system with an
average of 3.5 per day for the study period . Six different skidders were
timed during the project~-four were grapple and two were choker skidders.
Table 1 7 gives a summary of detailed timing for all the machines. Table 18
shows that on both a pieces-per -hour and a turns-per-hour basis , the grapple
skidders outperformed the choker skidders. As derived from the Table , the
choker skidder utilization was 89% compared to the grapple skidder utilization
of 62%. This difference was mainly due to one gr apple skidder being used
almost full time to forward wood from cold-decks and to do landing clean-up

When the choker skidders fed the Hahn Harvester directly, it caused
delay time for the harvester. This was because the Hahn loader had to wait
for the skidder operator to unhook chokers before he could resume loading
logs. The contractor corrected this problem by having the choker skidders
cold-deck, and the harvester was fed by a grapple skidder only.

Skidding resulted in the most economic cost. This was mainly
because of the lower total equipment cost per hour for skidders. Skidders
cost about $60 per hour whereas grapple yarders cost about $180 per hour.
Also , the skidder area had the gentlest terrain and the highest piece size
average.
When grapple yarding of bunches was compared with grapple yarding of
handfelled wood it was found that:
-

The cost of yarding bunches was $ 0.32/m 3 cheaper despite a piece size
disadvantage averaging 0.32 m 3 /piece.

-

The cost of yarding bunches was $1 .67/piece less than yarding nonbunched wood.

-

Pieces yarded per shift increased by 65% for the bunched wood. The
bunches resulted in better operator visibility ( a larger and more visible
target), and thus a better chance for the grapple to yard multiple pieces
per turn.

-

When windrowed, bunched wood results in all butts facing the road.
facilitates subsequent roadside processing.

Processing
A.

System 1 (Mechanically Felled, Grapple Yarded)

Roadside processing was done both manually and mechanically. Two
different models of Hahn Harvesters were tried for mechanical processing.
i.

Roadside Processing — Manual Processing

A Poclain HC 300 hydraulic log loader was utilized to pull trees out
of the windrow and place them on the road. Trees were then processed by one
or two hand buckers using chain saws (Figure H ). The second bucker acted as a
helper to the loader operator when he was not assisting with processing.
Processing included taping for length , long butting , limbing , bucking , and
topping. Pieces were then loaded onto trucks or decked for loading. Some
sorting was occasionally done.

FIGURE H.

Manual Processing.

Tables 21 and 22 give the results of detailed timing of the manual
processing.
When two buckers were utilized , there was a 37% increase in the
number of trees per productive hour. This is because of the increased taping
efficiency and less moving time per person.

Manual processing productivity was largely dependent on the log
loader. Normally, trees were pulled from the windrow and laid on the road
(parallel to the road) to be processed. Because of frequent waiting for trees
and logs to be moved, manual processing was productive only 26.8% of the time.
Table 23 gives a cost and productivity summary for manual processing
in System 1. The results are based on the detailed timing data.
The cost of manual processing includes the Poclain log loader (64%
of its time--operator and helper ), hand bucker , and chain saw costs. The
remaining 36% of the loader’s time is accounted for under loading in System 1.

Trees were pulled out of the grapple-yarded windrow by choker and
grapple skidders and cold-decked o n the road. They were then placed alongside
the Hahn Harvester infeed deck by a grapple skidder. Trees under 81 -cm butt
diameter were put through the Hahn Harvester. Each piece was delimbed,
measured for length , and bucked or topped. Long butting was done where
required. Processed logs were loaded directly or sorted and decked for
loading. Logs with greater than an 81 -cm butt diameter bypassed the harvester. Table 25 gives a summary of cost and productivity for the Hahn
Harvester.

Costs for the Hahn Harvester include the harvester itself (one

three skidders. T h e remaining 45% of the log loader’s time i s accounted for
under loading in System 1 .
Delimbing efficiency and quality was good o n limbs up to 9 cm in
diameter. O n those over 9 cm, the Hahn Harvester occasionally had t o process
them two or more times. Length accuracy was not checked by FERJC.
Skidders were observed t o be efficient in breaking down the grappleyarded windrows. The crew had several years of experience working together.
This was evident by the continuous wood flow in the skidding, processing,
sorting, and loading phases. There was also constant supervision which
increased efficiency.
iii.

Roadside Processing — Hahn 】I Harvester

T h e Hahn II Harvester was run by two operators—one o n the loader
and one operating the processor.

22

Trees were either pulled out of the windrow by the Hahn II loader ,
swung into lead , and placed in the delimbing carriage to start processing , or
trees were lifted from predecked piles and placed in the delimbing carriage.
Predecked piles were prepared by the Poclain HC 3〇〇 log loader , which would
pull trees from windrows and deck them parallel to the road to facilitate
processing. Trees under 81 -cm butt diameter were processed through the Hahn II
Harvester. Oversize logs bypassed the processor. Processed logs were loaded
direct or decked for loading by the Poclain log loader. Table 26 gives
details of observed processor time.

Normally , the Hahn II Harvester sat parallel to the road (Figure I ).
This meant the trees had to be lifted from the windrow and swung approximately
45 degrees to feed the machine. Much of the time , the Hahn II loader had
trouble breaking trees loose (tops entangled) and lifting them from the
windrow (piles up to 5~m high). This necessitated the assistance of the
Poclain log loader in preparing predecked piles. This assistance is the main
reason for the high delay time experienced in this system. The delay time
also includes the time waiting for the Poclain log loader to clear away
processed logs.
Delimbing efficiency and quality were good on limbs up to 9 cm in
diameter. On those over 9 cm, the Hahn II Harvester would sometimes have to
process them two or more times. Length accuracy was not checked by FERIC.

Because of long delays waiting for trees and logs to be moved ,
manual processing was productive only 34.9% of the time. Manual processing
productivity was very dependent on the Poclain log loader. Average piece size

ii.

Landing Processing--Hahn Harvester

The Hahn Harvester (one operator ) operated for two days in System 2.
The same method was used to recover logs from the windrows and forward them to
the Hahn Harvester as in System 1.
The skidders had problems maintaining the production rates in
System 1 because tree butts were facing both directions in the windrow. Much
of the skidder's time was spent getting trees untangled from the windrow. As
trees had to be skidded to the Hahn Harvester butt first , top ends were sorted
out and left for skidding from the other side of the windrow.
Table 31 gives the results of the detailed timing o n the Hahn Harvester
in System 2. Table 32 is a cost and productivity summary for the Hahn
Harvester, Barko log loader , and skidders used in this method of roadside
processing.
Costs for the Hahn Harvester include the harvester itself (one operator), Barko log loader (one operator and machine 55% of the time), and three
skidders. The remaining 45% of the log loader's time is accounted for under
loading in System '2.

Roadside Processing — Hahn I I Harvester

T h e same method was used t o process trees a t roadside as in System 1.
Table 3 3 gives the results of the detailed timing.
The high delay time (Table 3 3 ) was partly because the Hahn II loader
had trouble lifting and separating trees from the windrow (Figure J ) and
partly because the Poclain log loader was not present to clear away logs
processed by the harvester.

SYSTEM

«Machine utilized a t 7 5 % and manual processing a t 35%.

System 3 resulted in the most economic method of roadside processing. Skidding directly to the Hahn Harvester and then processing was $1 .34/m 3
or $1.39/tree less than the next lowest costing system.
On a cost-per-cubic-metre basis, System 2 is approximately 25%
cheaper than System 1. This is due mainly to the piece size variance, e.g.,
0.82 m 3 versus 0.53 m 3 .
Within System 1 , manual processing results in the lowest costs, but
also in the lowest production per manday. The lower cost reflects the high
capital cost associated with the mechanical processors.
In Systems 1 and 2, the Hahn Harvester cost includes three skidders
to pull material out of the windrows. Further experimentation may show it is
feasible to use only one or two skidders and reduce the cost.

31

In Systems 1 and 2, the Hahn II Harvester had problems with windrowed trees. Some of these problems were:
-

Trees were too large for the 9〇〇〇-kg lift loader.

-

Tops were tangled together--especially in the bunched-wood windrows.

-

Most trees had to be swung approximately 45 degrees for efficient infeed
alignment.

-

Trees whose tops faced the road had to be turned around. The windrows in
the handfelled area contained a lot of trees with tops facing the road.

Other significant delays occurred with the Hahn II Harvester
because processed logs were not cleared away and there was a lack of coordination between the log loader and the processor.
4.

Loading
A.

System 1 (Mechanically Felled, Grapple Yarded)
i.

Loading--Manual Processing

Loading of manually processed logs was done by the Poclain log
loader. Productivity and cost information is shown in Table 38 and is based
on approximately 22 hours of detailed timing.
Some cedar and pulp logs were sorted at roadside. The cedar was
highway-hauled directly to a local sawmill. All other loads were highwayhauled to the dryland sortyard at Northwest Bay. The pulp loads bypassed the
dryland sortyard processing area and were dumped directly into the water for
booming.
Production costs for loading include the Poclain log loader , operator , and helper for 36% of the time.
ii.

Loading--Hahn Harvester

A Barko 250 log loader cleared away logs processed by the Hahn
Harvester , sorted them four ways, and loaded them onto trucks. This did not
cause significant delays to the Hahn Harvester. In fact , presorting improved
loading productivity. When loading from presorted piles, the loader was able
to consistently pick up two or more logs. Also , the presorted piles facilitated the efficient loading of trucks. Detailed timing results for the log
loader are shown in Table 39.
Production costs for the Barko 250 include the machine and operator
for 45? of the time.
All loads were highway hauled to the dryland sortyard at Northwest
Bay. Pulp loads bypassed the sortyard processing phase and were put directly
in the water.

The smaller Barko log loader was less costly than the Poclain log
loader in all three systems. The main reasons are:
-

lower capital cost of machine ($1 25 000 versus $475 〇〇〇) ;

-

one man on the Barko (operator ) versus two on the Poclain (operator and
helper ); and

-

higher loading productivity (cubic metres and number of pieces).

It should be noted that the Barko log loader sorted logs four ways
as part of its normal function. This portion of its costs are included in the
Hahn Harvester cost. The sorting function did not appear to affect processing
or truck-loading productivity in any significant way. Similarly , the Poclain
log-loader costs associated with manual and mechanical processing are included
with those costs.

5.

Logging Residue from the Systems

Residue sampling to close utilization logging standards was done by
MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. , Woodland Services , in November and December , 1985. As
shown in Table 46, System 2 (handfelled) resulted in the largest amount of
residue left in the study areas. The System 2 residue volume was not necessarily the result of a machinery or system problem. Most of the volume was in
the form of small logs which were left behind because they were hidden by
debris and overlooked , or deliberately left because of their low value.

‘Avoidable residue includes high stumps , bucking waste , chunks, and
logs over 3 m i n length and 15 c m in diameter. Everything must be

Breakage occurred in all logging phases--i.e., falling, skidding,
yarding , processing , and loading. Falling breakage occurred as trees hit the
ground and when hit by other falling trees. In the skidding and yarding
phases, breakage occurred at the start of the inhaul and when hangups happened. Breakage also occurred when the backspar trail was being built and
widened. In the processing and loading phases, breakage occurred as pieces
were being pulled out of windrows. FERIC did not monitor breakage by phase
during this study.
Systems 1 and 3 resulted in less residue because:
-

Feller-buncher operators are able to direct and control the speed of
falling trees and thus reduce breakage.

-

Yarding and skidding of bunches results in fewer hangups and the bunches
retain their integrity as they are being yarded. Bunches also result in
fewer logs being hidden by debris and overlooked in the yarding phase.

System 3 had the best results because of the falling pattern and
skidding methods used. In this system, the skidders pulled straight on the
bunches at the beginning of the skidding phases. In System 1 , the grapple
yarder pulled sideways on the bunches at the start of the inhaul phase, and
more tops were broken.
6.

Overall Comparison of the Three Systems

Tables 4? and 48 compare all three logging systems, by processing
method, on a cost-per-cubic-metre and on a cost-per-piece basis.
System 3 resulted in the lowest cost per cubic metre and cost per
piece of the logging systems studied. The lower cost of skidding combined
with immediate processing and close supervision, made this a very productive
and cost-effective operation. On a per-cubic-metre basis, it was $3.66
cheaper than the next lowest costing system. On a per-piece basis, it was 13%
or $1 .00 cheaper.
System 1 resulted in the highest cost per cubic metre, primarily
because of the smaller piece size. When compared on a per-piece basis, it
became less expensive than System 2.

When comparing Systems 1 and 2, we find:
-

T h e $0.21 /piece higher cost of mechanical falling i s more than offset by
the $1 .67 favourable effect of grapple yarding bunched wood.

-

Roadside processing of handfelled wood (System 2 ) averaged about
$0.65/piece more than the bunched wood (System 1 ). This is mainly
because of the extra handling required when tops face the road in
windrows.

I n all three systems, roadside processing makes it possible t o
presort logs i n the woods. As shown in System 3 , this can be done very
efficiently and cost effectively. Presorting can result in additional savings
in the other logging phases, e.g ., booming , dryland sorting, and hauling
(Peterson 1986).

CONCLUSIONS
The falling pattern and method used i s critical to the yarding and
processing phases which follow. This i s shown i n the yarding phase where
bunching results in more productive yarding , and in the processing phase where
having all tree butts facing the road results in more productive processing.
Future FERIC research might study the effect of falling pattern, bunching
placement , and optimum bunch size.
Study results show that grapple yarding i s an acceptable alternative
when skidding i s not possible or if the company has yarders available. Grapple
yarding bunched wood proved t o be more productive and cost efficient than
grapple yarding handfelled full-tree material. There was a 6 5 % increase in
pieces yarded per shift and a 40% reduction in cost per piece.
The yarding grapple has a large effect on productivity. This report
shows a 20% difference in pieces/PMH between the two grapples used in the
bunched-wood area. Between the three grapples used in the handfelled area ,
there was a 75% variance.
Of the various processing methods studied, the Hahn Harvester operation was the most efficient and economical. Skidding to the Hahn Harvester
and processing directly was $1 . S1*/™3 and $1 .39/piece less than the next lowest
costing system. A s shown in the Hahn I I Harvester results , removing trees
from grapple-yarded windrows i s difficult. This problem i s unresolved and i s
a n area for further FERIC research. Experimentation with grapple skidders
pulling trees out of windrows may also be advantageous.
The smaller Barko log loader was less costly than the Poclain log
loader in all three systems. The Barko cleared away logs processed by the
Hahn Harvester , sorted them four ways , and loaded them onto trucks. The
sorting function did not affect processing or truck loading productivity in
any significant way.

40

Significantly less logging residue was left in the areas that were
feller-bunched than in the handfelled area. It is felt that this is owing to
the falling method, falling pattern, and the skidding/yarding methods used.
This may result in cheaper site-preparation costs after logging.
System 3 resulted in the lowest cost per cubic metre and cost per
piece of the logging systems studied. The lower cost skidding of bunches,
combined with immediate processing and close supervision, made this a very
productive and cost-effective operation. On a per-cubic-metre basis, it was
$3.66 cheaper than the next closest costing system and on a per-piece basis,
it was 13% or $1 .00 cheaper.
The large piece-size variance between Systems 1 and 2 makes the cost
difference per cubic metre appear insignificant. The piece-size differences
were caused by stand differences and the amount of residue volume left. For
these areas , the comparisons per piece handled give a clear er picture of what
is happening.
When comparing System 1 (mechanical falling and bunching , grapple
yarding) and System 2 (hand falling, grapple yarding), we find that the higher
cost of mechanical falling ($0.21 /piece) is more than offset by the favourable
effect of grapple yarding bunched wood ($1 .67/piece). Roadside processing of
handfelled wood averaged about $0.65/piece more than the bunched wood.
Historically , loggers have had a good grasp of their average logging
phase costs, e.g., falling, skidding , yarding , etc. This information is
useful and necessary , but more useful would be knowledge of the range of
logging costs and comparison values related to log volume , tree diameter ,
yarding distance , terrain features, and other variables (Adams 1965). T o fill
this need, FERIC has a Harvesting Economics Project underway. Initial work
has concentrated on falling and grapple yarding , and the first report will be
published in early 1987.

LOGGING COSTS

Costs used in this report are prepared by FERIC and are representative of the industry.
Operating labour costs consist of the IWA hourly rate for a particular job plus 35% for fringe benefits. Machine operators’ rates include
0.7 of an hour at overtime rates for machine servicing. For example, the IWA
rate for a grapple yarder operator is $17.73/hour. The hourly rate charged to
the job should be $17.73 x 1.35 = $23.94. To account for machine servicing,
the $23.94 should be adjusted by:
0.7 x $23-94 x 1.5
