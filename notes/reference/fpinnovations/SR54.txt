SUMMARY

As part of a series of studies on grapple-yarding techniques used in
logging Coastal second-growth timber, the Canadian Forestry Service, under the
Forest Resource Development Agreement (FRDA), contracted the Forest Engineering
Research Institute of Canada (FERIC) to examine the productivity of grapple
yarding mechanically felled and bunched timber. The study objectives were to
examine the effect of bunching on yarder productivity and to determine the
optimum bunch volume and marginal-log size. A Washington Model 118A yarding
crane was monitored on a shift-level basis for five weeks and at a detailedtiming level for two weeks. The yarding crane averaged 62.1 m3 /PMH, or 414
m3 /8-h shift over the study block. The average cost was $4.16/m3 • The study
block was located approximately 10 km south of Parksville, B.C., and the stand
was composed mainly of second-growth Douglas-fir.
During the two-week detailed-timing period, individual stems were
marked for identification, the bunch volumes and turn volume calculated, and the
yarding times for turns and bunches recorded. When a grapple with a 270-cm
opening was used, productivity increased as bunch volume increased for all observed bunches. For a 200-cm grapple, productivity was highest with 7-m3
bunches. Compared to a previous study (MacDonald 1987), yarding bunches instead
of individual logs increased the average log count from 1.2 to 2.9 logs per turn
and the average turn volume from O. 9 to 3. l ml .
The marginal-log volume was calculated using marginal economics analysis. The net value at roadside, and thus the marginal-log volume, was dependent
on the handling methods used in subsequent phases such as processing and loading.
When these costs were assumed to be piece-based, rather than volume-based, the
net value at roadside was reduced for smaller stems and the change in marginallog volume was not proportional to the change in number of stems in the turn.
For Douglas-fir J-grade logs yarded individually, the marginal-log volume was
0.54 ml, and when yarded in bunches of four stems, the marginal-log volume was
0.35 m3 • Based on these assumptions, 39% to 23% of the Douglas-fir J-grade logs
were submarginal.
The average turn time increased to 2.15 min from 1.25 min observed in
the previous study. Move and rig time occupied 16% of total time and most of
this time was for moving the guylines. Also, each yarding cycle had a long
fixed time to tighten the lines and engage the interlock.

INTRODUCTION
Yarding cranes have played an increasingly important role in Coastal
harvesting operations over the last 15 years, however, one of their shortcomings
has been their inability to yard multiple-piece turns consistently. It has been
demonstrated that yarding-crane cycle times are not closely related to turn
volume, and that yarding cranes often have capacity to yard more volume per turn
(Peterson 1987a). These two factors are especially important when yarding
second-growth timber where the average tree size is small. The opportunity
exists to increase turn size by yarding several pieces per turn. Mechanically
falling and bunching the timber is one possible method of increasing the average
number of pieces per turn and, therefore, the yarding crane's payload. Fellerbunchers are common in the Interior of British Columbia, but until recently they
have not been commonly used on the Coast.
The Canadian Forestry Service (CFS), under the Forest Resource Development Agreement (FRDA), contracted the Forest Engineering Research Institute of
Canada (FERIC) to monitor the profitability of grapple yarding timber which had
been mechanically felled and bunched. This report was prepared as a part of a
series of studies on yarding techniques used in logging Coastal British Columbia
second-growth timber. In the first study (MacDonald 1987), a yarding crane was
monitored as it grapple yarded hand-felled second-growth timber. It was found
that turn volume had the greatest influence on yarding profit, and that techniques should be developed to increase the turn volume and thereby increase
yarding profitability. As used in this report, "yarding profitability" assumes
that road construction, falling, ownership, and other costs are sunk costs, and
have no bearing on decisions to be made in the subsequent phases. Other FERIC
studies have also shown the effect of piece size, yarding distance, and falling
techniques on grapple-yarding productivity (Peterson 1987b, 1987c, 1988). The
objectives of this study were to examine the effect of bunching on yarding
productivity and to determine the optimum bunch volume and marginal-log size.
Data presented here were collected from a study area located near
Parksville, B.C., on the east coast of Vancouver Island, in MacMillan Bloedel
Limited's Northwest Bay Division. It was logged in February and March 1988 by
company crews using a Washington 118A yarding crane. The stand consisted mainly
of second-growth Douglas-fir, with minor amounts of pine, cedar, and other
species.
STUDY APPROACH AND PROCEDURES
The study involved two levels of timing:
detailed timing.

shift-level timing and

To collect shift-level timing data, a Model DSR Servis Recorder was
mounted on the yarding crane, and a chart was produced for each shift showing
productive and non-productive times. The operators identified each delay over
10-min duration on the chart, provided an explanation of the cause of each delay,
and recorded daily piece counts. Volume information was obtained from the
company'.s production records.
1

Data were collected relating to both logs in bunches and logs in turns.
For this study, bunches are defined as the groups of logs made by the fellerbuncher and turns are the groups of logs held at one time by the yarding grapple.
The study was carried out over five weeks. Shift-level data were collected for 24 production shifts and, during two weeks of this period, more
detailed information was collected on 1344 yarding turns. The yarding crane
operated on the block for one week before the Servis Recorder was installed.
For the detailed-timing study, cycle times were measured using electronic stopwatches. Minor delays (less than 10 min) were included in the machine
cycle, and longer delays were excluded. Log-butt diameters were measured prior
to yarding, and 10-cm diameter classes were marked on the logs to help determine
average turn volumes. Yarding distances, number of yarded logs, and number of
missed logs per turn were recorded. The angle of each bunch in relation to the
yarding road, measured in 30-degree classes, was estimated. Turns were classified by type, i.e. whether all target logs were hooked or some were missed,
whether it was the first or subsequent turn from a particular bunch, and whether
a log slipped from the grapple or was broken during yarding.
To help estimate turn volume, sample logs were scaled by a licenced
scaler according to B.C. Ministry of Forests and Lands' standards. Logs were
scaled either before or after yarding, depending on crew scheduling. Average
log volumes were calculated by butt-diameter classes and applied to the log
counts to calculate volumes per turn .
The costs included in this report are based on current IWA wage rates
and estimates of machine costs derived by FERIC from information supplied by
equipment and supplies distributors. They are not the actual costs incurred by
t he cooperating company, and costs such as supervision, overhead, and crew and
machine transportation are not included. Interest costs are calculated for
information (Appendix I), but are not included in the production costs within
the report.
SITE AND SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The study site was located on the east coast of Vancouver Island,
approximately 10 km south of Parksville, B.C. The stand was established in
approximately 1910. Table l shows a description of the site and Table 2 shows
the species and grade distribution derived from the company production records.
Arbutus trees were left at the roadside and were not scaled. The log grades
shown are B.C. Ministry of Forests and Lands' statutory grades; common-usage
log-grade definitions are included for information.
The logging area was generally flat and uniform with boundaries determined by surrounding roads rather than by terrain features. With the exception
of some small swampy areas, the soil was well drained and access for the fellerbuncher or mobile backspar was not restricted by soil-bearing capacity.

Trees were mechanically felled by a contractor using a John Deere 793C
feller-buncher with a Rotosaw falling head. Sterns were left tree-length for
roadside processing except those over 60-crn butt diameter which were hand-felled
and bucked into log lengths after the smaller trees had been felled. Company
personnel marked internal boundary lines prior to falling to help the fellerbuncher operator fall the trees with butts facing the truck road. It was planned
that the bunches should lie at approximately 45 degrees to the truck road to
facilitate yarding, but study results showed that the log angle varied throughout
the setting.
The number of sterns in each bunch depended on tree size and distribution, and varied throughout the setting. In Week 1 of the two-week detailedtiming study, the average tree size was larger (Figure A), many trees were handfelled, and the highest stem count per bunch was about 10 stems. In Week 2, the
average tree size was smaller (Figure B), and bunches with up to 23 sterns were
observed.

Large-Log Bunch:

Week 1.

FIGURE B.

Small-Log Bunch:

Week 2.

The feller-buncher cleared a path for the backspar through the felled
timber by piling sterns parallel to the haul road on either side of its path. No
attempt was made to pile them into bunches. When logging was in progress, the
mobile backspar moved these logs once again from their original positions to
facilitate yarding. FERIC observed that many turns from these piles were smaller
than normal because of difficulty in hooking multiple pieces.
Yarding was carried out with a 1978 Washington 118A yarding crane
(Figure C) with a mobile backspar. The Washington 118A is a modified Washington
118 (Phillips and Sauder 1978) in which the hydraulic interlock has been replaced
with a mechanical interlock. The current equivalent is the Washington 188
(Appendix II). Normal shift length was eight hours per day for five days per
week. During most of the detailed-timing period, a Hitachi UH 171 (Figure D) was
used for the backspar. However, during the latter part of Week 2 and the remainder of the shift-level study, a Caterpillar OSK bulldozer was used.

The yarding crew consisted of a yarding engineer (Operator 1), a hooktender, a part-time landingrnan, and a trainee operator (Operator 2). The trainee
operator was the sole operator for approximately 40% of the time, the regular
operator for approximately 20%, and the two shared duties for approximately 40%
of the study period. The regular operator had 10 years' experience on the
Washington 118A, and FERIC considered him to be skilled and efficient. Although
the second operator had some previous experience on the Washington 118A, he was
considered to be a trainee operator during the study. His times have been
included in the shift-level study, but excluded from some of the more detailed
analyses. The hooktender aided with guyline moves as well as spotting logs and
moving the backspar. The landingrnan was on-site for approximately three-quarters
of the time, and he prepared guyline stumps and assisted with guyline moves.
Stems were yarded to roadside and piled in windrows {Figure E) for
subsequent processing. Windrows were up to 4 m high depending on stand density,
stern size, and yarding distance. The stems were delirnbed and cut to length with
a Hahn Harvester which was fed by an American 7220C cable log loader. Logs were
loaded onto off-highway log trucks with a Caterpillar 225 hydraulic log loader
(Figure F). Haul distance was approximately 2 km to the sortyard at Northwest
Bay. During processing, logs were sorted into sawlogs and pulpwood. The sawlogs
were further sorted and scaled at the sortyard. The pulpwood was weigh-scaled
and then sent directly to a chipping facility at the sortyard.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Setting Layout

In addition to the existing roads surrounding the area, new roads were
constructed inside the logging area at approximately 250 to 300 m spacing
(Figure G). In one area during Week 1, the original backspar trail was positioned below a small ridge and its location had to be changed. Since the slope

6

averaged approximately 5%, deflection was reduced at longer yarding distances
(150-180 m) and the operators had to maintain high tension on the lines to keep
the grapple clear of the ground. This made it more difficult to control the
grapple during hookup. Minor slope variations (less than 5%) further reduced
deflection in some places. The flat ground also made it difficult to raise
heavy turns clear of the stumps, resulting in hangups and increased inhaul times.
However, these were minor difficulties, and the overall setting layout was very
good.

Shift Level Results

A Servis recorder, mounted on the yarding crane for 24 production
shifts, showed that the average shift length was 7.8 hours (Table 3) and the
actual yarding time averaged 5.2 hours per shift. Total production was 8778
trees with an average volume of 1.10 ml /tree. The average production was 376
trees, or 414 ml, per 8-hour shift . If the arbutus logs had been included in
the total volume, these production rates would have increased slightly. Total
machine time was about 187 hours. At an estimated cost of $211.07 per hour for
yarder, backspar, and crew, average yarding cost was $4.08/m3 •
Machine utilization was 83% during the study period. Yarding time
represented 67% of the total time, moving and rigging occupied 16%, while nonmechanical delays (3%) and mechanical delays (14%) made up the remaining time.
Further information on time distribution is in Appendix III and further discussion on moving time is in the detailed-timing section of this report.

The mechanical downtime ratio (MDR), defined as the number of repair
or service hours required for 100 productive machine hours, was 20.1 during this
study (Table 4). In-shift repairs totalled 24.3 hours. Some lengthy in-shift
repairs involved respooling the cables and repairing the grapple (8.9 h), repairing the air controls on the winch interlock (6.6 h), and adjusting the winch
brakes (2.1 h). Out-of-shift r e pairs consisted of repairing the guyline fairl e ad (2 h) and track frame (5 h ). The crew felt that the Washington 118A's
undercarriage was too light fo r the yarder and was the source of much downtime.

Deta iled-Timing Results

The detailed-timing study was completed in two weeks, although five
weeks were required to complete the ent i re study. The operating conditions
varied slightly from the first to the second week of the detailed-timing period.
During Week 1, the average yarding distance was longer and the trees were larger;
during Week 2, Operator 2 was working elsewhere. A swmnary of the detailedtiming results is shown in Table 5.

The productive time during the detailed-timing period was divided into
work-cycle elements (Appendix IV), and the results are shown in Table 6. The
portion of time spent in net yarding ranged from 59% to 67%, and averaged 63% of
productive time. A further 26% to 33% of time was spent moving the yarding crane,
backspar, or guylines, while 4% to 11% of productive time was ~pent in minor delays,
The average turn time, including moves and minor delays, ranged from 1.95 to 2.54
min per turn, and averaged 2.16 min for the 1344 turns which were timed.
Both operators were timed during Week 1, and the benefit of experience is
seen in the shorter cycle times for Operator 1. The difference is most apparent. in
hook-up time, as might be expected, but differences also occurred in outhaul and
inhaul times. The Washington 118A requires a specific sequence of actions to
tighten the lines and engage the interlock, and the more experienced operator was
able to perform those actions more quickly than the trainee operator.
The move and rig times for the two operators in Week 1 are not directly
comparable since the operators generally traded positions during yarder moves, and
times were arbitrarily assigned to one of the operators. The move and rig time for
Week 1 was shorter than for Week 2 for two reasons: the yarding distance was longer
in Week 1 and moving time represented a smaller portion of total time, and, for one
day in Week 1, the yarding crane remained stationary and the backspar moved in an
arc to cover the yarding area.

Overall, move and rig time represented 30% of productive time, and
move guylines time accounted for most of that time. Time per guyline move
averaged 23 min and 18 min for Weeks 1 and 2 respectively. The Washington
118A had two guylines side-by-side in one guyline block, and a third in another
block. The single guyline could be moved independently of the others, but the
double guylines had to be moved together to keep their alignment correct. This
doubled the amount of work and increased move times. Altering the blocks to
allow each guyline to be moved independently would reduce move times.
Minor delays occupied from 4 to 11% of productive time (Table 7). Of
these, mechanical delays were the most common, followed by talking on the radio
to the hooktender, waiting for the hooktender to move into position to spot
logs, and waiting for the hooktender to check the yarding road. Lengthy
miscellaneous delays in Week 2 included allowing traffic to pass the yarding
crane.

Turn Size and Bunch Volume

Table 5 shows the log counts averaged 2.0 and 4.1 logs per turn for
Weeks 1 and 2 respectively, and further detail is provided in Figure H. For
both weeks, turns with only one log were most common, although the proportion
of turns with more than four logs was greater in Week 2. This resulted in its
higher average number of logs per turn.

Turn volumes were calculated by multiplying the log count in each

class (Appendix V). For this analysis, arbutus logs were included in the log
count and their volumes were calculated from the log volume of the same
diameter class conifer log. Figure I shows the percentage of turns in each

TURN VOLUME CLASS (m3)

FIGURE I.

Turn Volumes:

Weeks 1 and 2.

Both weeks averaged 3.2 m1 per turn and had most turns in the 2-m3
class, but Week 2 had more variation in turn volume. The higher proportion of
1-m1 turns for Week 2 was offset by the higher proportion of 6-, 7-, and 8-m1
turns. Without these large turns, the average turn volume would have been much
smaller.
When an entire bunch is yarded with one turn, productivity should
increase as bunch volume increases, however, FERIC observed many turns where
the yarding crane failed to hook the entire bunch on the first turn.
Therefore, the data were examined to determine the effect of bunch volume and
number of turns per bunch on productivity. Three different grapples were used
during the study, and they will be discussed in detail later. The largest
grapple was selected for bunch-volume analysis.
The volumes of the original bunches were calculated and stratified
into 1-m1 classes. A distribution of bunch volumes was plotted showing the
percentage of each volume class yarded in one, two, or more turns (Figure J).
The proportion of multiple-turn bunches increased as bunch volume increased,
with a large increase at approximately 7 m1 • Only a small percentage of
bunches over 8 m3 were yarded in one turn.

The total yarding time, excluding minor delays and moving time, was

productivity is also shown. Productivity increased as bunch volume increased,
although the trend for bunches larger than 10 m3 was not clear. There did not
appear to be an optimum bunch size for this grapple . Since no delays were
included in the calculations, the productivity levels shown in Figure K cannot
be maintained over a typical operating period.

Grapple Comparison

Three different grapples were used during the study period; the company wanted to experiment with various grapples before purchasing one for a
new yarding crane. The grapples had maximum opening sizes of 270, 230, and 200
cm respectively. Table 8 shows the average bunch volumes and hook-up times for
each of the three grapples. Single-log turns were not included in the summary.

Note that Grapp1e 2 yarded only 22 bunches. The operators did not
like the grapple's balance, and it was quickly replaced. Because of the small
sample size, it was not included in further analysis.
Figure L shows the average turn volume versus bunch volume for all
bunches yarded by Grapples 1 and 3, and for multiple-turn bunches yarded by
Grapple 1. Because some bunches were yarded with only one turn, a difference
occurs between the two curves shown for Grapple 1 (approximately 0.5 to
1.0 rn3 /turn). The turn volumes for all bunches for both grapples were about
equal up to 7-m3 bunch volume, after which the turn volume for Grapple 3
declined.

BUNCH VOLUME (m3 )

FIGURE L.

Average Turn Volume Versus Bunch Volume.

The difference in average turn volumes between Grapples 1 and 3 was
caused by differences in average bunch volume. Grapple 1 had larger bunches and
its average turn volume was larger. Grapple 3 was used when the bunch volume was
smaller and its average turn volume was smaller. The smaller grapple's turn
volume declined for larger bunches, which showed that its optimum bunch volume
was 7 m3 • The average turn volume for Grapple 1 continued to increase as bunch
volume increased above 7 m3 , which showed it had not yet reached its optimum
bunch volume.
Felling practices were not monitored during this study, and it is not
known ho~ the operator determined individual bunch volumes, however, it appeared
that the operator placed as many stems as possible in each bunch. In a similar
15

stand, it may not be practical to build bigger bunches without decreasing fellerbuncher productivity. Thus, if further study showed that yarding productivity
could be increased with even larger bunches, the gains might be made only at the
expense of decreased feller-buncher productivity.
The operators preferred Grapple 1. They felt it was the more productive grapple, and it was used for the remainder of the study block. For simplicity, the following analysis will use only those turns yarded with Grapple 1.
6.

work-Cycle Elements Regression Analysis

The various cycle elements were examined to determine if they were
correlated with yarding distance or other parameters. No correlations were
found between hook-up, unhook, or decking times and yarding distance, or
between hook-up time and the log angle or the turn volwne. The average hook-up
time showed some correlation with the number of logs per turn--it was minimized
for five to seven logs per turn. Turns with fewer logs, which were often the
second turn from a bunch, had increased hook-up times because the logs had been
disturbed during the first hookup. And, for turns with more than seven logs,
the operator took extra time to ensure all the logs were hooked. However, the
correlation was slight and an average hook-up time will be used in the model
for turn time.
The best correlations were found between outhaul and inhaul times and
yarding distance, and when outhaul and inhaul times were summed, the correlation coefficients increased. Volume appeared to have an effect on outhaulplus-inhaul times, so the data were classified by turn volume and analyzed
separately for each volume class. Regression analysis using the least-squares
method was used to fit equations to the outhaul-plus-inhaul times versus
yarding distance (Table 9).

The regression coefficients were examined to determine if they had
some pattern. No clear pattern was found for the regression constants and an
average was used for all volume classes. However, the regression slopes
generally increased as turn volumes increased and an equation was derived
showing the regression slope as a function of turn volume. The final equation
for outhaul-plus-inhaul is:
Outhaul + Inhaul = 0.25 + d * (0.00455 + 0.00030 * V)

Using the model in Table 10, the machine utilization from Table 3, and
the turn volwnes for all bunches for Grapple 1 in Figure L, the turn times
were calculated for various bunch volwnes and yarding distances, and the net
productivity per hour was calculated (Figure O). Larger bunches resulted in
larger turn volumes, and larger turns affected productivity in two ways:
1) more volume was delivered to roadside with each turn, and 2) cycle times
were slightly increased. Figure o clearly shows that the negative influence of
longer turn times was outweighed by the increase in volume delivered to the
roadsi_de.

FIGURE O.

Predicted Yarding Productivity Versus Bunch Volume
For Grapple 1: Delay and Moving Times Included.

The three different yarding distances shown in Figure Oare examples
of the actual distance to the punch, not the maximum yarding distance for the
setting. The productivity for a setting where the boundary is 150 m from the
roadside, for example, is the weighted average of all three curves; it would be
incorrect to use only the curve for 150 m. Also, the curves include the
average move and rig times for Weeks 1 and 2, when the average yarding distance
was 77 m. If these curves are applied to another setting with a different
average yarding distance, the move and rig times per turn must be adjusted to
reflect the changing conditions.
The difference between Figures Kand o is caused by delays and moving
times. The gross productivity in Figure K ranges from 150-250 m3 /h for
average-size bunches, and the net productivity in Figure oranges from 50-80
m3 /h for the same size bunches.
8.

Marginal-Log Analysis

The marginal-log volume is defined as the volume of a log for which
the variable yarding cost is equal to the net value at roadside. The variable
yarding cost excludes any sunk costs such as road construction, falling, and
ownership costs, and the net value at roadside is the sales value of the log
less any further costs which must be incurred. If yarding standards are determined according to marginal-log analysis, net income will be maximized regardless of the volume extracted from the setting because logs above the margin add
to prof~t while logs below the margin reduce the profit. The first study in
this series (MacDonald 1987) showed that when yarding hand-felled timber, the
19

marginal-log volume was dete:cmined by species, grade, and turn volume with tum
volume having the greatest effect. In that study, the marginal-log volume for
J-grade Douglas-fir logs was 0.59 ml , and 24-461 of the J-grade logs were
submarginal.
Knowing the marginal-log volume can help the operator or hooktender to
decide whether or not to yard a particular log. However, some assumptions
must be made regarding subsequent phases before the marginal-log volume can be
dete:cmined. For example, some phase costs are more correctly applied on a per­
piece basis (processing and loading), while others are applied on a per-cubic­
metre basis (hauling). Therefore, a turn with one stem will have a different
net value at roadside than another turn with the same volume in four sterns.
As an example, the marginal-log volumes of one- and four-stem turns
with Douglas-fir J-grade sterns are calculated under the following assumptions:
- yarding time per turn is constant regardless of turn volume
- each stem produces one log
- each stem is processed and loaded individually
- processing and loading costs are constant regardless of stem size
- the production for each shift is 414 m3 , or 376 sterns (the average during
the shift-level study period)
- the market value is $41/m3 for Douglas-fir J-grade logs (Vancouver, B.C.,
April 1988)
- the combined stumpage and sales expense is 15% of market value.
The net value at roadside, which depends on stem size, must be determined
before the marginal-log value can be calculated, therefore, initial stem-size
estimates must be made. For 0.54- and 0.35-ml stems, the net values at road­
side are $12.19/ml and $4.73/m3 respectively (Table 11).
The time/turn was the average turn time during the detailed-timing
period, adjusted for utilization. The system variable cost was $153.40/h and
the average cost per turn was $6.62. The marginal-turn volume is calculated by
dividing the cost per turn by the net value at roadside, and the marginal-turn
volume is divided by the number of logs per turn to calculate the marginal-log
volume. Since the calculated volumes in Table 11 equal the initial estimates,
they are the correct volumes. If they had been different, new tree-volume
estimates would be made, and the process repeated.
Appendix V shows the percentage of Douglas-fir J-grade stems which
were smaller than selected volume-class boundaries for the scaled sterns. By
interpolating this table, it is seen that 23% of the Douglas-fir J-grade sterns
were smaller than 0.35 ml , or submarginal if yarded in bunches of four and 39%
were smaller than 0.54 m3 , or submarginal if yarded individually.
The marginal volume decreased as sterns were bunched. However, it did
not decrease in the same ratio as the increase in number of stems, i.e. yarding
four times the number of stems did not reduce the marginal volume by three­
fourths because of piece-based costs such as processing and loading. FERIC did
not monitor those phases during this study, so processing and loading rates
were assumed to be equal to the yarding crane's production. If the production
rate in each phase was different, the net value at roadside would change, and
the marginal-log volume would change. Further calculations based on assump­
tions.would be pointless, however, these calculations illustrate that bunching
20

reduces the marginal-log volume and that yarding profitability is influenced
by other phases. The other phases must be designed to handle stems on a volume
basis, rather than a piece basis, to maximize yarding profitability.

GRAPPLE YARDING HAND-FELLED VERSUS MECHANICALLY FELLED AND BUNCHED TIMBER
The first study in this series monitored a Madill 122 yarding crane
as it grapple yarded hand-felled second-growth timber (MacDonald 1987) . Some
comparisons can be made between results even though the equipment used for the
two studies was different (Table 12). Both settings were relatively flat and
uniform, although the Madill 122 had the advantage of elevated roads which
increased deflection and made hookup easier. The ·average yarding distance was
equal for the two studies.

Detailed-timing results

Both study areas were comprised of Douglas-fir timber of roughly
equal age and size, although average piece size was reduced in the case of the
Madill 122 because stems were bucked into logs before yarding. The Madill 122
normally yarded single pieces with an average of 1.2 logs per turn, while the
Washington llBA normally yarded bunches and averaged 2.9 logs per turn. The
average turn volumes were 0.9 ml and 3.1 m3 respectively.
Machine utilization during both studies was approximately 83%,
although the Madill 122 spent 80% of its time yarding and 3% moving. The
Washington 118 spent 67% of its time yarding and 16% moving. The machines
22

averaged 34.7 and 62.1 m3 /FMH, or 232 and 414 m3 /8-hr shift respectively.
average yarding costs were $5.68 and $4.16/m3 •

The

The average turn time for the Madill 122 was 1.25 min and for the
Washington 118A the turn time was 2.16 min; the net yarding times were 0.95 and
1.37 min respectively. The Madill 122 was faster during both yarding and
moving. The times for hookup, unhook, and deck were approximately equal, but
the outhaul-plus-inhaul time for the Washington 118A was approximately double
the time for the Madill 122 (0.74 versus 0,39 min). The regression models for
outhaul-plus-inhaul showed the Washington 118A actually had the higher line
speed, but it also had a long fixed time per turn to tighten the lines and
engage the interlock. The long fixed time caused the Washington 118A to have
the longer net yarding time.
The average moving time for the Washington 118A was 0.64 compared to
0.16 min per turn for the Madill 122. Fart of the difference is due to the
yarding system; since the Washington 118A yarded more pieces per turn, there
were fewer turns per setup, and the moving time per turn was increased. The
remainder of the difference was caused by the guyline arrangement on the
Washington 118A which increased the average time per guyline move.
Although the Washington 118A was slower and more expensive to
operate, the combined effect of tree-length yarding in bunches made it more
productive and cost efficient than the Madill 122.
CONCLUSIONS
The Washington 118A averaged 62.1 ml /FMH, or 414 ml /8-hr shift over
the study. The average yarding cost was $4.08/m3 • During the study period, it
averaged 83.3% utilization and 85.8% availability. Average turn time varied
from 1.95 to 2.54 min, including yarder and backspar moves and minor delays.
Yarding bunches increased the average number of logs per turn compared
to yarding hand-felled timber. During the two weeks of detailed-timing, the
Washington 118A averaged 2.9 logs and 3.1 m3 per turn. The average log size was
smaller during Week 2 than in Week 1, but a higher proportion of logs were
bunched in Week 2 and the average turn volumes were equal.
Three different grapples were used during the study, although one was
used for a short time only. With the remaining two, the average turn volume and
productivity increased as bunch size increased. Productivity for the larger
grapple continued to increase for all bunches observed, but with the smaller
grapple, turn volume was maximized when bunches were approximately 7 m3 • Further
research is required to find the optimum bunch size for the larger grapple, as
well as to document the effect of bunch size on the feller-buncher's productivity.
Active yarding occupied only 63% of productive time. The remainder was
divided between moving and minor delays. Most of the moving time was for moving
guylines; the Washington 118A required two of its three guylines to be moved
simulta~eously which doubled the amount of work. Modifications to the guyline
blocks to allow independent guyline movement should reduce its moving times.
23

The best correlations for cycle elements were between yarding distance
and turn volume and the sum of outhaul-plus-inhaul times. An equation was
developed showing outhaul-plus-inhaul times as a function of yarding distance
and turn volume. There was some correlation between the nwnber of logs in the
turn and the hook-up time, but the correlation was slight, and an average hook-up
time was used. The other cycle elements were not dependent on the parameters
measured (log angle, bunch volume). A model of the total yarding time was
developed which showed turn time as a function of yarding distance and turn
volume. The predicted turn times for selected yarding distances were used to
calculate productivity per hour.
Marginal-log analysis showed that bunching stems reduced the marginallog volume. An example showed the marginal volume for J-grade Douglas-fir stems
was 0.54 mi when yarded individually, and 0.35 m3 when yarded in bunches of four
sterns. Since the net value at roadside, and thus the marginal-log volume, was
dependent on handling methods in subsequent phases, the marginal volume could
not be stated with as much certainty as in the first study in this series.
However, the example showed that the marginal volume does not change in the same
ratio as the nwnber of logs in the turn. Under the assumed conditions, 39% to
23% of the Douglas-fir J-grade logs were submarginal.
