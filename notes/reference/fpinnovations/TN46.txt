SUMMARY
The Barko 450 Loader represented a modification to the central processing yard system reported in FERIC ’s Technical
Report No. TR-45. The machine had replaced a Caterpillar
966C front-end loader working at the bush landings.
The machine is a track-mounted hydraulic knuckle-boom loader equipped with a 360° rotating grapple. The grapple (designed primarily for loading tree-length wood) features two
outriggers (or live heels) for load levelling. The machine
weighs approximately 30 000 kg and the purchase price is
between $235,000 and $240,000.
Wood from two areas was loaded during the study period. The
first area was logged by feller buncher and grapple skidder,
with full trees piled at roadside for loading. Average tree
size equalled 0. 3 m 3 and the major species harvested was
lodgepole pine. In 32 days the Barko 450 loaded 20.5 million
kg , with a volume of 21 057 m 3 , for 349 off-highway truck
loads. The average volume per truck load was 60.3 m 3 and
the loader produced an average of 658 m 3 per shift.
The second area in the study was hand felled and cable yarded with a Washington 78 yarder. The full trees (average
tree size equalled 0.8 m’) had been piled along roadside.
The Barko loaded on to off-highway trucks. Some 5.6 million
kilograms (or 7 194 m 3 in volume) of wood was loaded onto 115
trucks in 11 days. Average volume per load for the trucks
was 62.6 m 3 and the daily loader production averaged 654 m 3 .
In both areas, the loader worked well. There were few repairs and machine availability averaged 96%. Machine utilization averaged about 79%. The difference (17%) reflected
the amount of time spent waiting for trucks , moving between
loading areas, sorting and decking logs. Improving machine
utilization would increase production and lower loading
costs, but this would require a more constant supply of logs
anQ trucks. For the ground skidding area of this study,
d ily production was limited to about 700 m 3 (or 12 〇f f highway truckloads) and so no improvement in loader performance was possible. The Note discusses some areas where
design changes to the operator 1 s cab are necessary. it also
provides some general observations on the loader operation
during the study.

BÁRKO 450 LOADER

INTRODUCTION
This Technical Note describes the use of the Barko 450
loader at two different operations, a ground skidding area
and a cable yarder setting. Productivity figures come from
both shift level and detailed timing studies for both areas.
The Barko uses a rotating grapple with live heels which
allow it to load multiple stems each pass , in contrast to
the normal heel-boom loader.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
This machine is a hydraulic knuckle-boom loader (see Figure
A.) It is mounted on a Chaptrac hydraulic undercarriage
model 500 and is equipped with a Weldco model XG-125 360°
rotating grapple. The loader has a horizontal reach of 10.1
metres and a lifting capacity of 23 600 kg at 3-metre
radius. The boom and cab assembly has continuous 360°
swing capability, and the cab is equipped with joy-stick
controls. The grapple also has a 360° continuous rotation
and a 4.5 m 3 capacity. It is equipped with live heels on
each side of the grapple for controlling the logs during
loading (see Figure B.) The undercarriage is equipped with
the EXPANDO feature allowing the width to be increased
hydraulically from 3.7 m to 4.3 m to improve stability
during loading. The undercarriage has travel speeds up to
3.2 km per hour.
More details of the machine specifications are presented in
Appendix I.
The machine weighs about 30 000 kg, and the purchase price
is currently between $235 ,000 and $240 ,000.

D E T A I L S OF O P E R A T I O N
The loader worked at two different locations during the
study period. The first of these was a feller-buncher and
grapple-skidder operation in stands of small pine. The logs
were piled at roadside (see Figure C) and loaded onto offhighway trucks. The truck haul was about 35 km to the
Peachland yard, a central processing area. Here the full
trees were limbed, bucked and topped using a Hahn Harvester
and also a flail with manual bucking and topping. The
processed logs were then reloaded and trucked on-highway to
the mill. This operation (excluding the Hahn Harvester) is
described in more detail in FERIC's Technical Report No. TR45*. Piece size averaged 0.31 m 3 per log.
The second area consisted of a cable yarder operation located
to the west of Kelowna. The stands of spruce and balsam fir
were manually felled, and yarded to roadside by a Washington
78 cable yarder (see Figure D). After loading by the
Barko, full trees were hauled by off-highway trucks for
about 30 km to the 4-Mile yard, a central processing area.
Here the trees were flail or manually limbed, bucked, topped
and then reloaded for a short 8-km haul, again off-highway ,
to a water dump on Okanagan Lake. Piece size averaged 0.8
m 3 per log.

COMPARISON WITH FRONT-END LOADER
From Hedin's study of a central processing yard logging
system, loading in the bush landings with a Caterpillar
966C front-end loader gave different results for winter and
summer.
In winter, average time to load an off-highway truck was 22
minutes per load, with an average load volume of 69.5 m 3 .
In summer, a 60.2 m 3 load was assembled in 45 minutes. Most
of this difference was attributed to the inexperience of the
summer operator.

7

This operator switched to the Barko loader when it replaced
the Caterpillar 966C for loading the skidder wood at Peach!>and. From Table 3 we see that his loading time with the
Barko 450 was 32 minutes per load of 62.6 m 3 . These results
show an improvement in operator performance as experience
increased, and indicates also that the two machines have
equivalent loading rates.
The front-end loader has a lower purchase price than the
Barko. It requires a landing to function efficiently, and
the landing requires good supervision to ensure a smooth
flow of wood through it. The Barko can operate from roadside piles without a need for landings. More wood can be
decked at roadside than can be stored at normal sized landings. This permits cold decking of wood during break up.
Also the problems associated with wet muddy landings are
avoided. The Barko is more versatile than a regular heelboom loader because of the 360° rotating grapple. For
loading yarder wood the Barko shows more promise because it
does not need landings. It functions well with both small
and large logs. Its major disadvantage occurs with ground
skidded wood to landings, when the slow travel speed between
landings reduces available loading time per shift.

GENERAL COMMENTS
The loader worked well during the period of the study.
There were very few repairs made in that time. Therefore
machine availability figures are high. A longer study
period is necessary to predict a more normal level , expected
to be in the 80 to 85% range. The amount of time reported
as non-mechanical delay is accounted for by the following
activities：
-

moving between loading points
adjusting log piles prior to loading
preparing positions for loading
waiting for trucks to arrive at loading points.

All of these activities can be considered as inherent in
loader activity. Efforts to improve loader utilization and
control loading costs would look at these as areas for improvement. At Peachland , there was no potential for improvement. Loader productivity is limited to 12 off-highway

8

loads per day. The loader must be there to load these
trucks and any idle time between loading is unavoidable.
The 12 off-highway loads provide the daily throughput for
the yard — 250 cunits or 700 m 3.
Logs from the yarder setting were larger than from the skidder shows, 0.8 m 3 compared to 0.3 m 3 per piece. They were
piled more haphazardly and the loading area was not level.
These points affected the loader in the following ways:
-

time was spent by the loader preparing loading
points along the roadside.

-

from the loading points, it was not always possible to grapple the logs at a point close to the
centre of gravity. This made it difficult to
free long logs from the piles, especially if tops
and branches were intertwined.

-

the variety of log lengths required careful selection and placement of the bunk logs on the
truck and also of the final logs of the load.
Frequently the truck driver assisted with positioning of the final few logs of each load.

-

at the beginning of the shift, lights were required. The lighting on the Barko gives good
illumination around the grapple and close to the
machine. With the long logs from the yarder,
there was insufficient illumination of the tops
of the logs. The operator, therefore, could not
determine if a log was tangled with others and
had difficulty extracting such logs from the
pile. The addition of a swivelling spotlight on
the cab would solve this problem.

-

the combined width of an off-highway truck and
the loader was greater than the road width. Consequently the loader was often working from a low
position straddling the ditch. This gave poor
visibility of the logs in the pile and the logs
on the truck , as a load neared completion. Slower loading times resulted.

-

the live heels were not powerful enough to stabilize long logs unless they had been grappled
close to the centre of gravity. This weakness

9

was particularly evident when loading the yarder
wood where the piling had been haphazard.
the off-highway trucks used "cheater bars" to increase the height of the front stakes. A similar
arrangement on the rear stakes would have helped
loading of the yarder wood, which was light and
required large loads to achieve good load weights
for the trucking. The loader spent time adjusting the logs on the load to prevent them from
falling off.
Logs from the skidder area were smaller (0.3 m 3 per piece)
and more neatly piled along the roadside. The terrain was
flatter and the loader had a better working environment.
Movement between loading points on the ground skidding show
was slow due to the low travel speed of the loader.
A full ergonomic evaluation of the loader was not made. The
following comments refer to areas where design improvements
are needed to enhance operator safety.
~

The flat deck area between the cab door and the
top of the access ladder needs a nonslip surface.
It is 2.7 m (9 ft) above the ground. Spilled
fuel and oil, and ice accumulation in winter,
could make the present surface extremely hazardous.

“

The operator's seat is adjustable for height and
weight of operator. It does not swivel and the
operator has to climb over the seat to get into
position, using the cab heater as a foot rest.
This causes undue wear and tear on the seat. it
does not allow the operator to exit quickly in
the event of an emergency.

The user company hoped to achieve 3 main objectives by using
the Barko 450 loader , as follows：
-

improved skidder productivity
reduction (or elimination) of landing construction
reduction of tree breakage during loading.

Achievement of these 3 objectives was considered sufficient
justification for the higher loading costs and longer loading times expected with the Barko. To date results show

10

that the first two objectives are being achieved. It is
anticipated that the third objective will also be realized,
although some breakage was noted when intertwined trees were
freed from roadside piles during the loading of yarder wood.

CONCLUSION

The use of the Barko represented a modification to the central processing yard system, where it replaced a Caterpillar 966C front-end loader working at the bush landings.
The Barko handled the required daily volume of wood (up to
700 m 3 per day) efficiently and neatly. It achieved a high
level of mechanical availability (96%). In comparison, the
966C front-end loader averaged 835 m 3 per day in winter
with an experienced operator , and 540 m 3 in summer with a
less experienced operator.
The Barko loader works without landings so trees can be
skidded or yarded to roadside piles for loading onto trucks.
During the study, it loaded off-highway trucks with both
skidder wood and yarder wood at rates of 658 m 3 in a 10.5
hour shift and 654 m 3 in an 11.3 hour shift, respectively.
It compares favourably as an alternative to the front-end
loader, and also to a heel-boom type loader for yarder wood.
