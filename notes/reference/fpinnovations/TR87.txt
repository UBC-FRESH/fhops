Summary

Sommaire

FERIC monitored all phases of a roadside logging
system in one block of old-growth timber in the
British Columbia Interior. The study objectives were
to determine the productivity and cost of each logging phase, and monitor the interactions between
phases.

FERIC a assuré le suivi technique de toutes les
phases d’une exploitation par système en bordure de
route, dans une parcelle d’un peuplement originel en
Colombie-Britannique intérieure. L’étude avait pour
but de déterminer la productivité et le coût de
chacune des phases de la récolte, et d’étudier les
interactions entre les phases.

The prime logging equipment consisted of a Caterpillar FB221 feller-buncher, a John Deere 740A grapple skidder, two Timberjack 90 processors, and a
Caterpillar LL229 butt-and-top log loader. The total
volume logged was 24 146 m3, the piece average was
0.29 m3, and the direct stump-to-truck logging cost
was $8.1 1/m 3. Road construction accounted for a
further $0.25/m 3 and bulldozer costs, to pull log
trucks through muddy road sections, amounted to
$0.06/m 3. Costs were derived by FERIC and are not
the actual costs incurred by the company or the contractor.
Study results showed that approximately 1.5 falling
and processing hours were required for each skidding
hour, and that about 1.5 skidding hours were required
for each loading hour. Production by phase varied
from 544 m 3 per 8-hour shift for the loader, to 240
m 3 for the TJ90 processors. Falling and processing
each accounted for 33% of direct logging costs, while
skidding, and loading each accounted for about 17%.
The utilization of machines ranged from 67% for one
TJ90 processor to 92% for the LL229 loader. Major
causes of delay were organizational delays and repair
and service. Up to 10% of the skidder’s and processors’ total shifts and 7% of their time during production shifts was lost because of wait-for-wood delays
when the FB221 feller-buncher was unable to fall
sufficient trees for the other machines to maintain full
production. A second feller-buncher was added and
no further delays were caused by insufficient inventory.
The machines’ repair requirements varied.
The
LL229 loader required the least time for repairs, at
2.5 hours per 100 productive machine hours (PMH),
and one TJ90 processor required the most time for
repair at 23.8 hours per 100 PMH. In general, the
falling and processing attachments required the most
repairs.
There was little variation in productivity per PMH
between day and night shift. However, utilization on
night shift was generally higher, so production per
shift was higher. This was mainly because minor
repairs were scheduled during the day and repair
times per shift were 0.3-0.6 hours longer.

L’équipement utilisé comprenait principalement une
abatteuse-groupeuse Caterpillar FB221, un débardeur
à pince John Deere 740A, deux ébrancheusestronçonneuses Timberjack 90, et une chargeuse
Caterpillar LL229 dotée d’un grappin à talons jumelés
pour le chargement bidirectionnel des grumes. Le
volume total de coupe était de 24 146 m3, le volume
moyen d’une pièce de bois de 0,29 irf, et le coût
direct de débardage entre la souche et le camion de
$8.1 1/m3. La construction des routes représentait
$0.25/m 3, et le coût des bouteurs nécessaires pour
tirer les camions sur les sections de routes boueuses,
s’élevait à $0.06/nf. Ces coûts ont été calculés par
FERIC et ne sont pas nécessairement les coûts réels
encourus par la compagnie ou l’entrepreneur.
Les résultats de l’étude montrent qu’il fallait
approximativement 1,5 heure d’abattage et de
façonnage pour chaque heure de débardage, et
environ 1,5 heure de débardage pour chaque heure de
chargement. La production pour une phase variait de
544 m3 par poste de travail de 8 heures pour la
chargeuse, à 240 m 3 pour les ébrancheusestronçonneuses TJ90.
L’abattage et le façonnage
représentaient chacun 33% des coûts directs
d’exploitation, alors que le débardage et le
chargement correspondaient chacun à environ 17%.
Le taux d’utilisation des machines passait de 67%
pour une ébrancheuse-tronçonneuse TJ90 à 92% pour
la chargeuse LL229. Les principales causes de temps
morts étaient les retards dus à une organisation
déficiente, ainsi que les réparations et l’entretien.
Dans le cas du débardeur et des ébrancheusestronçonneuses, jusqu’à 10% du temps total d’un poste
de travail et 7% du temps productif étaient perdus à
attendre du bois, parce que l’abatteuse-groupeuse était
incapable d’abattre suffisamment d’arbres pour que les
autres machines travaillent à pleine capacité.
L’addition d’une seconde abatteuse-groupeuse mit un
terme aux temps morts causés par l’insuffisance
d’ approvisionnement.
Les réparations nécessaires variaient d’une machine à
l’autre. La chargeuse LL229 était celle qui demandait
le moins de temps de réparation, soit 2,5 heures par
100 heures-machines productives (HMP), et celle qui
en demandait le plus était l’une des ébrancheusestronçonneuses TJ90, soit 23,8 heures par 100 HMP.
En général, les accessoires d’abattage et de façonnage
demandaient de nombreuses réparations.

On constata peu de variation dans la productivité par
HMP entre les postes de jour et de nuit. Toutefois,
le taux d’utilisation était généralement plus élevé
durant le poste de nuit, de sorte que la production
par poste se trouvait plus forte. Cela s’explique
principalement par le fait que les réparations
mineures étaient prévues durant le jour, ce qui
ajoutait de 0,3 à 0,6 heure au temps de réparation
par poste.

INTRODUCTION
As part of its harvesting-systems evaluations project,
FERIC undertook to monitor a roadside-logging system as a whole, rather than to isolate one machine
for study. The objectives of this study were to determine equipment performance and costs, and to document how one machine’s productivity affects another’s
performance.

Table 3 lists the equipment used to harvest the study
block. Trees were mechanically felled and bunched,
then skidded to roadside with a grapple skidder
where they were piled in windrows for processing
and loading.
Falling, skidding, and processing
operated two shifts per day for five days per week,
while loading and hauling operated one shift per day
for five days per week. The operators alternated day
and night shifts on a two-week cycle.

Roadside logging has become an increasingly
important system of logging in the Interior of British
Columbia. Landings are not required for roadside
logging, thus eliminating their cost, reducing site
disturbance, and reducing the interference between
logging phases caused by landing congestion.
Instead of landings, stems are piled along the roadside (windrowed) for processing and loading. Safety
is also improved because the workers are inside protective cabs at all times. However, capital costs are
increased, and it becomes more important to ensure
maximum machine utilization to ensure lowest costs.

Table 2. Log-Size Distribution

The study was conducted in cooperation with Quest
Wood Products Ltd. of Quesnel, B.C. The company
harvests much of its timber supply from low-volume
pine stands where the average tree size is small and
the logging system must be designed to process a
large number of stems rapidly to minimize logging
costs. The logging contractor employed during the
study had used roadside logging since 1986. His
fleet consisted of one feller-buncher, one grapple
skidder, two stroke delimbers, and one butt-and-top
log loader, plus miscellaneous other equipment.

SITE AND SYSTEM
DESCRIPTION
The study block was located approximately 85 km
west of Quesnel, B.C. The species distribution information shown in Table 1 was obtained from the
company’s operational cruise data and the total
volume was derived from the weigh-scale of all production. The data in Table 2 on log-size distribution
were obtained from four sample truck loads which
were scaled for stumpage purposes. The site was on
a gently rolling ridgetop and the slope averaged
11%. The terrain was typical of Quest Wood

The contractor usually preferred to maintain five to
seven days’ inventory between logging phases for
flexibility and to avoid interference between equipment
However, start-up in the block was delayed
for various reasons, and both the company and contractor were anxious to start each phase as quickly as
possible when logging finally commenced. Therefore, skidding and processing both started four days
after falling, and the loading five days after that.

and skidding patterns, and Figure D shows the
FB221 feller-buncher during operation.

Road Building

Truck roads were built with a Caterpillar D8H bulldozer after falling and prior to skidding. The contractor operated the D8H bulldozer in addition to
doing his normal supervision duties. The study block
was 97.5 ha, and had 4.9 km of road for a road
density of 50 m/ha. The maximum skidding distance
was about 300 m, with the average distance to the
boundary approximately 220 m. Company crews did
the engineering layout for the truck roads.

Falling

Falling was carried out mainly with a Caterpillar
FB221 feller-buncher using a Koehring 51-cm-diameter circular-saw felling head. One operator was
new to the feller-buncher but had several years of
experience on other equipment, while the second
operator had one year of experience on the fellerbuncher. The feller-buncher was approximately one
year old.

Skidding

A two-year-old John Deere 740A grapple skidder was
used for skidding. It operated for two shifts per day
and both operators had several years of experience on
the skidder.

Since the FB221 feller-buncher was unable to provide
sufficient felled inventory, a John Deere 693B with a
Denis twin circular-saw felling head was hired on a
subcontract basis. The owner/operator had several
years of experience operating feller-bunchers.

The skidder generally pulled two bunches per turn.
Trees were dropped at the roadside and their butts
aligned to the road edge with the skidder blade.
Depending on stand density and skidding distance,
the piles were up to 3 m high, although most were
about 2 m high. The skidder operators left low
openings in the piles to maintain access to the block.
Figure E shows the 740A skidder pulling an uphill
turn.

A third feller-buncher was used for a short time on
the study block. Finning Ltd. supplied a Caterpillar
FB217 feller-buncher for a demonstration, but FERIC
did not monitor its performance.
The falling pattern was dictated by the preferred
skidding direction which was directly up or down the
slope. The feller-bunchers started by cutting a corridor along the back boundary or midway between
the parallel roads, then working back and forth across
the slope. Trees were grouped in bunches of six to
ten stems, with the butts facing the truck road.
Figure C shows the block layout, with typical falling

Processing

Two Timberjack TJ90 processors were used during
the study. One worked two shifts per day, while the
other was operated either one or two shifts per day.
The TJ90 processors consisted of a Denis Model KS
telescoping-boom stroke delimber mounted on a
Timberjack rubber-tired carrier (Figure F).

Three of the four operators had from 6 to 8 months
of experience on the processors, but the fourth operator had no machine experience and was considered a
trainee operator.
The processor operators varied their work patterns
depending on the inventory of skidded stems. Where
the inventory was adequate, the two machines
worked 100-200 m apart, one on each side of the
road. At other times, the stems were processed as
soon as they were skidded. A typical windrow of
processed logs is shown in Figure G.

Loading, Hauling, & Other Activities

Loading was carried out with a Caterpillar LL229
butt-and-top log loader equipped with a Tanguay
grapple and boom. The loader was about 18 months
old. Two different operators were used during the
study; the first was experienced on feller-bunchers
but was new on the loader, and the second was fully
experienced on the loader.
The loader travelled to
the far end of each spur road to begin loading, and
required two passes to complete the loading from
both sides of the road.

Figure C . Study-Block Layout.

Nine highway trucks were used to haul the logs to
the mill, and each averaged about two trips per day.
The average haul distance was 85 km. The main
configuration was a cab-over tractor with a jeep and

triaxle trailer. This truck configuration was a consideration in the loading pattern, i.e. commencing at the
end of each spur, since the tractor-jeep/triaxle trailer
configuration is very difficult to drive in reverse once
the trailer is unloaded. This loading pattern had two
disadvantages:

STUDY METHODS
Each machine was equipped with a Model DSR
Servis Recorder to monitor working and delay times.
The operators identified each delay over 10-min
duration and provided an explanation of its cause.
Delays under 10-min duration were considered part
of productive time.
FERIC grouped the delays
according to their causes, and measured productive
and non-productive times from the Servis Recorder
charts using a digitizing tablet connected to an IBMcompatible computer.

a) Cycle time was increased because the loader
operator swung the logs over the back of the truck
(Figure H). This was done to reduce the risk of
truck damage that might result from swinging logs
over the cab.
b) The loader could not work on the same spur as
the processors because access for the trucks would
be blocked.

The total harvested volume was derived from the
actual weigh-scale of all production delivered to the
mill. When more than one machine or machine shift
was used for a phase, production was allocated
between machines or shifts based on the operators’
daily piece counts.

The final piece of equipment used in this logging
system was a Clark Ranger 668 line skidder which
was used to pull trucks through muddy sections of
road. It was operated by the contractor or another
operator as the need arose.

The 693B and the FB217 feller-bunchers were not
equipped with Servis Recorders. The 693B fellerbuncher operator reported total trees cut and total
cutting hours, and these were used to estimate production. The total cutting time for the FB217 fellerbuncher was reported, and its cutting volume was
estimated based on the average number of trees per
hour for the FB221 feller-buncher. Other than calculating their portion of total production, these machines are not used in the data analysis.

Planned post-harvesting treatment involved piling and
burning debris left at the roadside, and possibly scarifying the setting. The company planned to rely on
natural regeneration and to check stocking levels in
two to four years.

The study was carried out over seven weeks, starting
in late May 1987.

RESULTS AND
DISCUSSION
Scheduling Intensity

Every shift for each machine was recorded from the
first day to the last day worked on the study block.
Shifts were classified as production shifts, non-production shifts, or scheduled shifts off. Any amount
of production classified a shift as a production shift.
A non-production shift was one which was scheduled
for production but where some event such as repairs,
vacations, or a lack of raw materials prevented the
machine from working. Scheduled shifts off were
weekends and statutory holidays.
Table 4 shows the scheduling intensity for the five
main machines. Most machines averaged 26-30%
scheduled shifts off, but the FB221 feller-buncher
had only 20% scheduled shifts off because it was
operated for several weekend shifts to increase the
inventory of felled trees. It also had 79% production
shifts compared to 61-70% for the other machines.
Non-production shifts were divided into mechanical
and non-mechanical classes.
Non-mechanical lost
shifts were due to the lack of stems to skid or
process. The 740A skidder lost 7% of its shifts, the

TJ9O#1 processor 5%, and the TJ90#2 processor 10%
of its potential shifts for this reason. These shifts
were lost during the first half of the study. However,
during the latter half of the study, the second fellerbuncher was hired and no further shifts were lost
because of insufficient felled inventory.

The remaining organizational delays were for such
things as the LL229 loader waiting for trucks, movein time for the TJ90#l processor, and operators
working on other duties. Other duties included operating the spare skidder to pull trucks through muddy
sections of road, and using the TJ90#l processor to
lift repair parts onto the FB221 feller-buncher. The
main operational delay was for breaks. Meal times
were excluded from machine times and are not
shown in any summaries.

The TJ90#2 processor was on-site about 20 shifts
less than the other machines because:
a) Its start-up was delayed until there was sufficient
skidded inventory for a second processor.

Production Allocation - The scaled volume for the
study block was 24 146 m3. Table 7 shows the
calculated volume distribution between shifts based
on the operators’ daily tree counts for the falling and
processing phases.

b) It was initially scheduled for one shift per day to
increase the inventory of skidded stems.
c) Muddy conditions at the end of the study slowed
skidder productivity.
There was insufficient
skidded inventory to operate two processors, and
the TJ90#2 was shut down.

Turn counts for the skidder were incomplete, and the
day and night shifts were combined for analysis.
There were no tree counts for the FB217 fellerbuncher. Its tree count was estimated from its total
operating hours and the average cutting rate and
utilization for the FB221 feller-buncher.

The LL229 loader was scheduled for one shift per
day, and it worked for every scheduled shift during
the study period.

The volumes for the trainee processor operator have
been excluded from Table 7 and all subsequent production calculations. His average productivity was
approximately 14.7 m 3/PMH and was not representative of the TJ90 processor’s potential productivity.

Shifts with Production

The scheduled time for shifts with production was
divided into three categories: productive machine
time, non-mechanical delay time, and mechanical
delay time (Table 5). The average utilization for the
five machines during the study was approximately
78%. The LL229 loader had die highest utilization
at 92%, and the TJ90#2 processor the lowest at 67%.

Summary of Productivity - The production rates for
the four main machines are shown in Table 8. The
loading phase will be considered separately from the
falling, skidding, and processing phases.

Delay Times - The delay times were examined to
explain the range in utilization. A major reason for
the TJ90#2’s low utilization was high repair time, and
this is discussed in a later section.

The utilization for the 740A skidder was 80% during
the study. However, if its wait-for-wood delays are
eliminated, its scheduled machine hours (SMH)
would be 534.6 and the utilization would be 84%.
Similarly, the average utilization for the processors
would be 76% if their wait-for-wood delays are
removed.

The non-mechanical delay times were further divided
into two categories: organizational delays, which are
generally controllable by company policy, and operational delays, which are not controllable by policy.
Table 6 shows that, because the FB221 feller-buncher
was unable to fall enough trees to maintain sufficient
inventory, waiting for wood was the main organizational delay affecting the skidder and processors.

The skidder had the highest productivity (m3/PMH)
and the highest utilization as well. Using the calculated utilization when wait-for-wood delays are eliminated, its productivity was 361 m3/8-h shift. There

were no wait-for-wood delays for the FB221 fellerbuncher, and its productivity was 233 m3/8-h shift.
The average productivity of the two processors was
240 m3/8-h shift each when the wait-for-wood delays
are eliminated.
Using these production rates, 1.5
feller-buncher and 1.5 processor hours are required
for each skidder hour. Depending on equipment
availability, mill requirements, fixed costs, and setting
layout, the logging manager and contractor can use
this number to plan the equipment fleet, production
quota, and hours of work.

As an example of the options available in choosing
the amount of equipment to use, the system could be
planned to have two skidder shifts, three feller-buncher, and three processor shifts per day. Alternatively, the feller-buncher and processor could each
work two shifts per day and die skidder would be
idled part-time. Another option would be to alter
road spacing to match more closely the skidder’s
productivity to the other machines. If the average
skidding distance was reduced, road costs would
increase, but the skidder could service two full-time
feller-bunchers and processors. Conversely, if the
average skidding distance was increased, road costs
would decrease, and the skidder might service only
one feller-buncher and processor. Clearly, there is
flexibility in allocating equipment to meet various
corporate and contractor objectives.

Ideally, the production rates for all phases should be
matched exactly, so that no phase is delayed by
another. However this is very difficult to achieve
under actual conditions where the balance between
phases changes as operating conditions change.
Inventories between phases can buffer production-rate
differences, but eventually one phase will set the
pace for the system.

Comparisons of Day-Shift Productivity and NightShift Productivity - The productivity in cubic metres
per PMH showed little variation between day and
night shift. The FB221 feller-buncher’s productivity
was approximately 1% higher during the day and the
TJ90#l and TJ90#2 processors had higher productivity at night by 1% and 4% respectively.

In the system studied, the FB221 feller-buncher was
the critical machine until a second feller-buncher was
added. Two processors were used, but not on a fulltime basis. Only one skidder was used, and it had
some excess capacity, as shown by its wait-for-wood
delays. It would have been the critical machine in
the system if these delays had been eliminated, however, a second feller-buncher would have been
required part-time. If a second feller-buncher had
been fully utilized, an additional skidder would have
been required part-time. Similarly, to fully utilize
two processors, a second full-time feller-buncher and
part-time skidder would be required.

However, utilization varied between shifts with night
shift generally having higher utilization than day
shift. Repair hours were 0.3-0.6 hours per shift
longer on day shift than night shift because, presumably, minor malfunctions were left unrepaired on
night shift when no mechanic was available. The
difference in utilization made the night shifts more
productive on an 8-h basis. The exception was the

necessary, is cut with the rear chain saw ("longbutted"). Stems larger than the maximum stroke

TJ90#2 processor. It lost 8.6 h one night and was
down until the following morning with a breakdown
in its hydraulic system. If this breakdown had not
occurred, its utilization would have been 64% compared to its actual 48%, and closer to its day-shift
utilization of 68%. The TJ90#2 processor also had
several long wait-for-wood delays, and since only
five night shifts were recorded, these delays disproportionately affected its utilization.

A summary for the total detailed-timing period for
the TJ90#l processor is shown in Table 10. The
processor was observed handling up to three trees at
a time, but it usually processed stems individually
with an average of 1.07 stems per cycle. Six percent
of the stems were forked and produced three logs per
stem.
Otherwise, each stem produced one log
because the average stem size was small.

Loader Productivity - The loading productivity is
summarized in Table 9. The loader averaged 16.9
loads with 47.7 m3/load over an average shift of 11.9
hours. The average loading time was 0.65 PMH per
load and included the time required to unload the
truck trailers.
The remaining time was evenly
divided between repairs, service, and waiting for
trucks.

The productive time (Table 11) was divided into
three components: net processing time, move time,
and minor delay time. Net processing was further
divided into three elements: grasp log time (which
ended when the stem was secured in the rear grab
arms), delimb and cut time (which ended when the
final topping cut was made), and discharge time

Detailed Timing of the TJ90 Processor - As mentioned, the TJ90 processor (Figures I and J) is a
Denis Model KS stroke delimber mounted on a
Timberjack rubber-tired carrier. FERIC made some
detailed-timing observations of the TJ90#l processor
to examine its work cycle.

Table 9. Loading Summary

The Denis stroke delimber consists of a telescoping
boom, with two sets of grab-arms and two hydraulically driven chain saws. During processing, the stem

sors, and the loader.
Summaries of all the machines’ activities, including
the duration and frequency of all repair delays are
shown in Appendix I.

Move and minor delay times made up a small portion
of the productive time. The minor delays were primarily for decking logs and moving debris.

There was a wide range in Mechanical Downtime
Ratio (MDR) for repairs on the various types of
equipment, ranging from 2.5 for the LL229 loader to
23.8 for the TJ90#2 processor. However, the MDR
for service showed less variation, averaging from 8 to
10, except for the LL229 loader which averaged 2.7.
Time spent waiting for parts or mechanics is not
included in the MDR.

Nearly one quarter of the processor’s productive time
was spend discharging the log. It may be possible to
reduce discharge time by altering the operating technique. Normally, each stem was held with the rear
grab-arms about 1 to 2 m from the butt, and had to
be pulled out of the rear grab-arms after the final cut
was made. If the stem were held closer to the butt,
it could simply be dropped, eliminating the time
required to pull the log out of the grab-arms. However, this would affect the alignment of the outfeed
deck, and therefore might affect the loader’s productivity.

FB221 Feller-Buncher - The boom and felling head
accounted for 60% of repairs to the FB221 fellerbuncher. The boom knuckle pin broke twice, and
15.6 hours were required to replace it. Hydraulic
component repairs accounted for 15.5 hours of the
repair time, and approximately 55% of this time was
for structural damage to the tool and grab-arm cylinders (broken mountings). The remainder was for
replacing hoses and fittings. The wiring for the grabarms was replaced, accounting for part of one lost
shift, as well as 8.1 hours of on-shift repairs.
Sharpening the saw blade accounted for 4.3 hours of
repair time.

Butt diameters were estimated to the nearest 10 cm
as the stems were processed, and processing times
calculated for each class (Table 12). In addition,
whether or not the stem was long-butted or required
a second stroke was recorded. The size-class distribution refers to the detailed-timing period and is not
representative of the whole stand. The class volumes
were calculated from four truck loads which were
sample-scaled by the company and then adjusted to
account for multiple logs per stem.

The FB221 feller-buncher has a self-levelling cab,
and the cab-tilt cylinders broke twice. Part of the
lost shift was spent repairing the cab-tilt cylinder.
Other frequent carrier repairs were to recharge the air
conditioner and to repair lights.

The processing time per stem and the volume processed per minute increased as butt diameter
increased. This resulted in lower daily tree counts
but higher daily volumes as stem size increased.
Because the shift-level productivity was calculated
using average tree volumes, the effect of stem size
on productivity was lost in the shift-level analysis.

Unspecified repair accounted for 14% of the mechanical delays. These all occurred during one week
when the operators neglected to provide explanatory
notes with the Servis Recorder charts.

Four percent of the observed logs were long-butted,
with an average increase in processing time of 0.07
min/stem. The 10-cm diameter class had the highest
increase in processing time - 0.13 minutes.

The FB221 feller-buncher was serviced every shift,
using a total of 8.4 hours per 100 PMH.
740A Skidder - There were two recurring mechanical problems on the 740A skidder.

A second stroke was required for 38% of the stems,
and an extra 0.10 min/stem was required each time a
second stroke was used. However, the processing
times for the 30-cm-diameter-class stems actually
decreased when a second stroke was used, the opposite of what might be expected. Possibly the boom
slows down at full extension and increases the processing time when only one stroke is used. If so, it
may be advantageous to make two short, quick
strokes on the 30-cm diameter-class stems rather than
one long stroke.

a) Alternator. The alternator was replaced five
times over eight working days. Once the short
circuit which caused the problem was identified
and repaired, there were no further electrical problems on the 740A skidder. Repairs totalled 8.6
hours.
b) Grapple brake. A hydraulically operated grapple brake, activated by the grapple-closing cylinder, was installed on the 740A skidder. The brake
was engaged when the grapple was fully opened,
and was released when the grapple was closed.
This was the prototype of the brake and the concept worked well, keeping the grapple stationary
while the brake was engaged.
However, six
repairs totalling 8.3 hours were required on the

Repair and Service

Repair and service time occupied from 5% to 21% of
time during productive shifts, plus 0% to 3% of total
shifts. This section highlights some of the repairs.

brake, indicating the design was inadequate to
withstand operating stresses.
Other repairs on the 740A were minor in nature.
TJ90 Processors - The two processors had dissimilar
repair experience:
the TJ90#l processor had an
MDR of 12.2, and the TJ90#2 processor had nearly
twice that amount at 23.8. However, the TJ90#2
processor had only 60% of the productive hours as
the TJ90#l processor, thus each repair had a proportionately larger effect on the MDR.
Most of the MDR difference was due to repairs on
the carrier, which varied for each processor. The
TJ90#l processor had four repair delays, totalling 6.8
hours, when its transmission was sticking in gear.
Other lengthy repair delays on the TJ90#l processor
involved sealing the main hydraulic tank, repairing

the rear-axle stabilizer arm, and refilling the radiator
three separate times. The TJ90#2 processor had an
intermittent problem in its electrical system. There
were 13 delays, totalling 16 hours, plus one shift
with no production, to find and correct the short
circuit. The alternator, batteries, and solenoid were
each replaced twice before the fault was corrected.
Repairs on the delimber itself accounted for twothirds of repairs on the TJ90#l processor and onehalf on the TJ90#2 processor.
The repairs for
various components of the delimbers were examined,
and the MDRs for structural repairs (approximately
2.0), cutting tools (approximately 3.5), and miscellaneous parts (approximately 1.0) were found to be
similar for the two machines. However, the rates of
repairs for hydraulics and electronics for the TJ90#2
processor were twice that of the TJ90#l processor
(3.9 versus 1.9 for hydraulics, and 1.7 versus 0.8 for

direct logging cost, which totalled $8.11/m 3.

electronics).
The hydraulic control block for the
topping saw and grab-arms on the TJ90#2 processor
was repaired twice, accounting for most of the difference in the hydraulic MDRs. Both machines had
MDRs of approximately 2 for broken hydraulic lines
and fittings. Replacing wiring and switches were the
main electrical repair delays on both delimbers. The
repairs were not specific to any single component.

The falling and processing phases were roughly equal
in productivity and costs, with each costing approximately $2.70/m 3, or 33% of direct logging cost.
Skidding and loading each accounted for about 17%
of the direct logging cost.
The productivity ratio in Table 14 expresses each
machine’s productivity relative to the loader’s productivity. The skidder worked approximately 1.5 hours,
and the feller-buncher and processors approximately
2.3 hours for each hour the loader worked.
Expressed in other terms, the feller-buncher and
processors included 1.5 shifts for each skidding shift.

Both processors experienced numerous delays for
repairing or replacing saw chains and bars. On
average, the processors encountered a chain- or barrepair delay once every 1.5 shifts, and the average
duration was 0.3 hours. Approximately 42% of the
delays involved tightening the chain and 23% involved replacing broken chains. Thirty percent of the
delays were caused by broken or bent bars and 5%
by broken bar tips.

The D8H bulldozer was used for approximately 75
hours to build truck roads.
At $78.88/h, this
amounted to $0.25/m 3 for on-block road construction.
An additional 17.5 hours were spent pulling trucks
through soft sections of road, or $0.06/m 3. Hours for
the 668 skidder were not recorded.

In addition to repairs, the processors averaged
approximately 0.2 hours per shift for servicing (fuelling, greasing, oil levels).
LL229 Loader - The LL229 loader was found to be
mechanically reliable during the study, with an MDR
for repairs of only 2.5. Approximately one-half of
the delays for the attachment occurred on the first
shift after spring start-up. Some fittings in the grapple swivel had been left loose and required tightening. The remaining attachment repairs were for three
broken hoses. The other long delay occurred when a
mechanic from the equipment dealership was required
to adjust the motor. Downtime was 3.6 hours.

Service time for the LL229 loader was less than the
other machines since the loader was usually serviced
between trucks, during productive time. These service delays were less than 10 minutes in duration and
they did not appear as separate activities on the

shift and accounts for the service delays.

CONCLUSIONS
The machines in a logging system must be chosen to
compliment the capacity and productivity of one
another because system productivity is normally
determined by the capacity of one phase. Delays
will occur somewhere in the system if the total capacity of one phase is much different from any others
for reasons such as individual machine productivity,
the number of machines used in the phase, or their
hours worked. Initially, in the system studied, falling
was the critical phase and delays occurred for both
skidding and processing. A second feller-buncher
was added, falling capacity was increased, and skidding became the critical phase.

Cost Calculations

FERIC calculated hourly cost rates for each machine
(Appendix II).
These are not the actual costs
incurred by the company or contractor, and do not
include such costs as crew and machine transportation, supervision, office overhead, and profit and risk.
Interest charges are shown in Appendix II, but are
excluded from the cost of production. The labour
rates are IWA rates, and include 35% burden for
fringe benefits. Costs are shown on an 8-hour shift
basis and include the net hourly cost of one hour
labour at overtime wage rates.

The organizational delays were primarily wait-forwood delays. The skidder and processors lost from
5% to 10% of their potential shifts and up to 7% of
their time during productive shifts because of insufficient inventory. When all delays were considered,
utilization ranged from 67% for one TJ90 processor
to and 92% for the LL229 loader.

The production rates calculated in Tables 8 and 9
were used to calculate the cost/m 3 for falling, skidding, processing, and loading. The costs are based
on the productivity levels when the wait-for-wood
delays were removed from the skidding and processing phases. Table 14 summarizes the daily productivities for each phase, as well as the percentage of
11

Study results showed that production was 233 m3/8-h
shift for the feller-buncher, 361 m3/8-h shift for the
skidder, and 240 m 3/8-h shift for the processors. In
other words, approximately 1.5 falling and processing
hours were required for each skidding hour. Waitfor-wood delays were removed to derive these
figures. These results were also seen in the final
equipment fleet used by the contractor: one fellerbuncher, one skidder, and one processor on two shifts
per day each, and a second feller-buncher and processor on one shift per day. One log loader was used,
and it averaged 544 m3/8-h shift. It is possible that
productivity per PMH would have been higher for
the skidder and processors if there were no wait-forwood delays because of an increase in operator motivation.
The total volume logged was 24 146 m3 and the
direct stump-to-truck logging cost was $8.11/m 3.
Road construction added $0.25/m 3 and extra bulldozer
costs were $0.06/m 3. Falling and processing each
accounted for 33% of costs, while skidding and loading each accounted for about 17%. Costs were
derived by FERIC and are not the actual costs
incurred by the company or contractor. Costs such
as interest, overhead, machine and crew transport,
and profit are not included.
Repair and service time accounted for 5% to 21% of
scheduled machine time plus 0% to 3% of potential
shifts. The LL229 loader required the fewest repairs,
at 2.5 h/100 PMH, and the TJ90#2 processor the
most at 23.8 h/100 PMH. Service time added from
2.7 to 10.4 h/100 PMH. In general, the falling and
processing attachments required the most repairs,
accounting for 48% to 67% of repairs. Frequent
repairs on the feller-buncher were to repair hydraulic
components such as fittings and mountings.
Hydraulics were also problem areas in the processors,
although repairs to the chain saws were also quite
frequent.
There was little variation in productivity/PMH
between day and night shifts. The TJ90#2 had the
most variation, with 4% more productivity at night
Also, utilization was generally higher on night shift
so production per shift was higher. This was mainly
because minor repairs were scheduled during the day
where repair times were 0.3-0.6 h/shift longer.
Some detailed-timing data were collected on one
TJ90 processor to examine its work cycle. Nearly
one quarter of its processing time was spent discharging the logs and it may be possible to reduce this
time by altering the operating technique. Also, for
stems in the 30-cm diameter class, processing time
was less when two strokes per stem were used rather
than one stroke. This knowledge may help operators
reduce processing times for stems of this size.
