Abstract
In 1997, the Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada ( F E R I C ) studied a partial cutting operation in the
Interior Cedar-Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone, on a site west of Kitwanga, B.C. The operation used a Skylead C40
16000 skidder-mounted yarder and Mini-Maki II radio-controlled carriage in a standing skyline configuration and in
single- and multi-span applications. The study provided information on productivity and cost for the harvesting system,
impact on soil surface conditions, and damage to the residual stand. Productivity functions were derived to predict
yarding productivities and costs over a range of operating conditions.

Summary
In 1997, the Forest Engineering Research Institute of
Canada (FERIC), in a project funded by Forest Renewal
B C , studied a skyline yarding system over short and
long yarding distances and with and without
intermediate supports. The study site was an Interior
Cedar-Hemlock stand near Kitwanga, B . C . The
operation used a Skylead C40 16000 skidder-mounted
yarder and a Mini-Maki II radio-controlled carriage in
a standing skyline configuration. Partial cutting
employing a combination of narrow strip-cuts and group
selection was prescribed for the study site to address
visual, recreational and silvicultiu-al objectives.
The yarding pad:em applied in the block consisted of
parallel yarding corridors spaced approximately 50 m
apart and oriented perpendicular to the contours. To
acconunodate the skyline system, a 10-m-wide corridor
was clearfelled and group-selection or occasionally
single-stem removals were applied to the 40-m-wide
strips of residual stand between yarding corridors. A target
removal of 40% was set for this entry, with future enuies
at about 30-year intervals removing up to 30% of the
stand basal area and volume at each subsequent entry.
FERIC assessed the economic and operadonal feasibility

of the harvesting system used and determined the
overall productivity and cost for all phases of the
operation; developed productivity functions to relate
productivity and cost for the yarding phase to external
and lateral yarding distances, use of intermediate
supports and other significant variables; identified
operational factors affecting system performance and
recommended improvements where appropriate;
documented damage to residual stems and changes to
soil surface conditions resulting from falling and
yarding activities; and evaluated the visual impact of
the harvest.
F E R I C found that falling

productivity was 99 mVshift
and yarding productivity was 102 mVshift. The total
cost for falling, yarding, processing and loading was
S32.95/m\ The post-harvest survey showed that 5.4% of
the residual .stand was woimded; no pou:ntially detrimental
site disturbance was found in the cable-yarded area.
Operationally, falling was the most critical phase
because the placement of stems directly affected
yarding productivity and leave-tree damage. This study
confirmed that it is essential to have a logging plan that
considers all factors including backspar and landing
locations, falling pattem and direction, location and
loadpath analysis for yarding corridors, and other
naturcd resource values. Clearly defined silvicultural

objectives for locating skyline corridors and lateral rows
were necessary to fulfil the objectives of this operation,
and to mininuze the impact of harvesting on stand
stmctiire while maximizing economic retums.

En 1997, dans le cadre d'un projet fmance par Forest
Renewal B C , I'Instimt canadien de recherches en genie
forestier (FERIC) a etudie un systeme de telepherage a
cable porteur sur de coiutes et de longues distances de
telepherage, ainsi qu'avec et sans pylones
intermediaires. L'aire d'etude etait situee dans un
peuplement de cedre-pmche de la zone interieure, pres
de Kitwanga, C.-B. On utilisait un cable-gme Skylead
C40 16000 monte sur debardeur, et un chariot MiniMaki n telecommande dans une configuration de cable
porteur a tension fixe. Une coupe partielle combinant
des coupes par bandes etroites avec un jardinage par
bouquets etait prescrite pour l'aire d'etude, afin de
satisfaire a des objectifs visuels, recreatifs et sylvicoles.
Le schema de telepherage applique dans le bloc
consistait en corridors de telepherage paralleles, espaces
approximativement aux 50 m et orientes
perpendiculairement aux courbes de niveau. Pour
permettre 1'installation du telepherique, un corridor de
10 m de largeur etait coupe a blanc, et on procedait au
jardinage par bouquets et occasionnellement au
prelevement d'arbres individuels dans les bandes
residuelles de 40 m de largeur entre les corridors de
telepherage. L'objectif de prelevement etait fixe a 40 %
pour cette coupe, avec des coupes futures a intervalles
d'environ 30 ans pour enlever jusqu'a 30 % de la
surface terriere et du volume du peuplement a chaque
passage subsequent.
L'etude de F E R I C consistait a evaluer la faisabilite
economique et operationnelle du systeme de recolte
utilise et a determiner la productivitd et le cout
d'ensemble pour toutes les phases dc I'operation; a
developper des fonctions dc productivite pour etablir
les relations entre la productivite ct le cout dc la phase
dc telepherage d'une part, ct les distances extcmes ct

les dommages aux tiges residuelles et les changements
aux conditions de la surface du sol resultant des activites
d'abattage et de telepherage; et a evaluer I'impact visuel
de la recolte.

FERIC a trouve que la productivite a I'abattage etait de
99 m^/poste de travail et la productivite au telepherage
de 102 mVposte. L e coiit total pour I'abattage, le
telepherage, le fa9oruiage et le chargement s'elevait a
32,95 $/m^. L'evaluation apres coupe a revele que 5,4 %
des arbres residuels presentaient des blessures; aucune
permrbation potentiellement nuisible du site n'a ete
constatee dans l'aire de telepherage.
A u plan operatiormel, I'abattage etait la phase la plus
critique parce que la position des tiges affectait
directement la productivite du telepherage et les
donunages aux arbres residuels. Cette emde a confirme
qu'il est essentiel d'avoir un plan d'exploitation tenant
compte de tous les facteurs, y compris I'emplacement
des pylones arriere et des jetees, le schema et la
direction d'abattage, I'Euialyse de I'emplacement des
corridors de telepherage et du trajet suivi par la charge,
ainsi que d'autres valeurs liees aux ressources

maximisant la rentabilite economique.

INTRODUCTION

OBJECTIVES

Forest management practices in Britisli Columbia are
changing rapidly to better accommodate the
management of non-timber resources. Pjutial cutting
prescriptions are encouraged, and in some cases
required, to meet these management goals. Experience
with partial cutting is still limited for many of British
Columbia's forest ecosystems, and research is needed
to learn how to conduct efficient harvesting operations
under these regimes. In this operational trial, performed
by Kitwanga Lumber Co. Ltd., the Forest Engineering
Research Institute of Canada ( F E R I C ) examined the
performance of a skyline yarding system in a partial
cut in an Interior Cedar-Hemlock (ICH) stand. F E R I C
observed the system over short and long yarding
distances, and with and without intermediate supports.

The primary goal of this stody was to assess the economic
and operational feasibiUty of using a skyline-yarding
system for partial cutting in an I C H stand. The
following specific objectives were established to
address this goal:

The site for this trial was located at Wilson Creek, 22 km
west of Kitwanga, B . C . Partial cutting employing a
combination of narrow strip-cuts and group selection
was prescribed for the study site to address visual,
recreational and silviculmral objectives. Portions of the
cutblock are visible from Highway 16 and the Visual
Quedity Objective (VQO) for the site is Partial Retention.
Hiking opportunities and the presence of a heritage trail
nearby also favoured partial retention.

• Develop productivity functions to relate
productivity and cost for the yarding phase to
external and lateral yarding distances, use of
intermediate supports, and other significant
variables.

Although literamre about partial cutting is abundant
(Daigle 1995), the ICH biogeoclimatic zone is not well
represented. Trials near Kispiox, B . C . of groundbased harvesting systems (grapple skidders, line
skidders and horses) in clearcut, heavy-removal and
light-removal s i l v i c u l t u r a l treatments were
documented by Thibodeau et al. (1996) for the same
ecosystem as this study (ICHmc2). However, the
application of cable yarding systems in partial cutting
prescriptions in the ICH zone has not yet been studied.
Also, while the yarder and carriage used in this trial have
been studied in other ecosystems (Forrester 1993a, b;
Hedin and DeLong 1993), it is not clear how reliably
the results of these smdies can be extrapolated to the
I C H zone. This study addresses this particular
information gap.

Although a fiill evaluation of the biological and aesthetic
implications of the harvest prescription was beyond the
scope of this study, the following secondary objectives
were set to provide information on these topics:

This project was funded by Forest Renewal B C and
addresses one of its strategic investment priorities
under its Land and Resource Research program, that
of partial cutting. This study contributes information
to the forest industry in its continuing effort to develop
economically feasible and biologically acceptable
harvesting practices for partial cutting prescriptions for
the full range of site and stand conditions in British
Columbia.

The study site was located in the Kispiox Timber
Supply Area, between Wilson and Duncan Creeks on
the north side of the Skeena River (Figure 1). Of the
total cutblock area of 79.2 ha, 48.7 ha were skylineyarded, 14.4 ha were skidded with low ground pressure
skidders, and 16.1 ha were in reserves and deferred
areas. The skyline-yarded area included 6.0 ha of haul
roads, landings and rock-pits, leaving a net area of
42.7 ha.

• Determine overall productivity and cost for the
falling, yarding, processing and loading phases of
the partial cutting operation.
• Analyze the effects on yarding productivity of
external and lateral yju-ding distances, of using
single skyline spans (no intermediate supports)
and multiple spans (one or more intermediate
supports), and of other site and stand variables.

• Identify operational factors affecting system
performance and recommend improvements
where appropriate.

• Document damage to residual stems and changes
to soil surface conditions resulting from falling and
yarding activities.
• Illustrate the visual impact of the operation by
photographing from selected viewpoints, the
cutblock before, during and after harvesting.

To accommodate the skyline system, 10-m-wide yarding
corridors (5 m on either side of the skyline) were
clearfelled. Group-selection or, occasionally, single-stem
removals were applied to the 40-m-wide strips of
residual stand between yarding corridors. Corridor
locations were determined by the engineering crew, and
the centreline of each corridor was flagged (corridor
boundaries were also flagged on a few corridors). Also,
backspar and intermediate support trees were selected
and marked while corridors were being located.

Description of IHarvesting Pliases
For the first two weeks, two fallers experienced in
partial cutting were used. Thereafter, only one of them
worked on the site. At the start of each corridor, the
faller did a reconnaissance of the corridor centteline
and measured 5 m on each side of it to determine its
boundaries. The faller felled both the corridor and small
pockets of 1 to 5 ttees off the corridor in a one-pass
operation. Smmps were cut low to the ground and on
an angle, to minimize hangups during yarding. No
delimbing or bucking was done in the bush, except for
very large ttees.
Tables showing the existing and residual stand strucmre
and the plaimed cut for each timber type were given to
the faller by the forestry superintendent, as well as
suggestions on how to select ttees within pockets.
The cable-yarding operation was configured as a
standing skyhne and employed a small tower yarder

and radio-conttolled carriage. The yarder was a Skylead
C4016000 skidder-moimted machine with a 12.2-m tower
(Figiu-e 3), powered by a 124-kW Cummins engine, and
used a 19-nmi (3/4") swaged skyline and 13-mm (1/2")
IPS mainline. The yarding crew was comprised of a
yarder operator, a chaser and one or two chokersetters.
A Mini-Maki 11 motorized radio-controlled carriage
was used (Figure 4). This is a clamping-type carriage,
which can be locked to the skyline adjacent to the turns
to be yarded. The carriage's on-board 6.7-kW motor
powers a capstan which feeds slack from the mainline,
and the chokersetters can then pull the chokers laterally
to the hook-up site. When the tum is hooked, the
chokersetter signals the yarding engineer to draw the
tum laterally towards the skyline corridor. Once the
tum is suspended under the carriage, the clamp is
released and the carriage and mm are yarded to the
landing. This carriage can tolerate changes in direction
of up to 8 degrees in horizontal (plan) alignment of the
skyline when yarding over intermediate supports.
A Hitachi E X 270 L L log loader (Figure 5) worked with
the yarder to clear the landing and also to load tmcks from
decks of processed logs. This often required the loader
to ttavel long distances, as relatively small piles of logs
were widely dispersed along the haul roads. In some
cases, yarder-assisting and truck-loading activities
conflicted, resulting in delays in loading tmcks or in
clearing the landing for the yarder Intiielatter case, large
piles of logs accumulated under tiie skylme, which made
unhooking of turns difficult and time-consuming.

cable-yarded areas of the cutblock. Company highway
tmcks hauled the logs to the Kitwanga Lumber Co. Ltd.
mill, approximately 20 km from the study site.

Rigging Systems Used in the Study
A variety of rigging configurations was used to deal with
the variable terrain conditions and yarding distances in
the cable-yarded portion of the cutblock (Figure 2 and
Table 2). The most fi-equently used configuration was
single-span yarding uphill with a standing tree used as
a backspar (i.e., gravity skyline or shotgun), which
accounted for 39% of total corridor length.
The layout presented in Figiu-e 2 was respected, except
Corridor 51 could not be used because the designated
intermediate support was not considered satisfactory.
To compensate, lateral corridors aligned in a
herringbone pattern were felled and yarded from
Corridors 50 and 52.

Figure 4.

For single-span yarding uphill (with fixed or mobile
backspars), corridor lengths ranged from 40 to 350 m.
For multi-span yarding, lengths ranged from 200 to 420 m.
The average external yarding distance was 65 m for
single-sp£m ysu-ding and 146 m for multi-span yarding.
Lateral yarding distances ranged fi-om 0 to 50 m.

Mini-Maki II carriage after passing the
intermediate support.

Where yarding roads terminated at a haul road (33%
of total corridor length), a Caterpillar E L 300 excavator
was used as a mobile backspar (Figure 6) and this
reduced the rigging time for corridor changes. Multispan yarding was required on only 6 corridors but these
accounted for 21% of total corridor length. Stumps
were used as tailholds on short uphill-yarding corridors
(3% of corridor length), and the haulback line had to
be used to pennit downhill yarding on 5 short corridors
(4% of total corridor length).

Occasionally, a Clark Ranger 668 grapple-skidder was
used to clear the landing when the loader was not
available.
Logs were mechanically processed at roadside, initially
by a wheeled Timberjack processor equipped with a
Denis head, and later by a Pierce processor mounted
on a Hyundai 290 L C tracked undercarriage. The loader

Intermediate supports were alsoriggedwith three nylonstrap guylines. Like the backspars, these were attached
between 0.5 and 1.5 m above the tree-strap rigging
point. To support the skyline jack, a tree block was hung
on the tree strap. The snake (i.e., the line that supports
the skyline jack) passed through the tree block, then
back to a tailhold tree perpendicular to the yarding
corridor and opposite the guylines (Figure 8). The snake
was then tensioned with a grip puller to raise the
skyline jack into its working position and to pull it
away from the intermediate support to provide yarding
clearance. Intermediate supports were pre-rigged
whenever possible.
Constmction of landings was minimal in diis operation;
whenever possible, logs were decked by the roadside.

METHODS
FERIC was on site almost full time for the duration of

Backspar trees were rigged with three (or occasionally

double-ply nylon straps with self-tensioning clamps

0.5 and 1.5 m above the tree-strap rigging point.
Rigging heights on the backspar trees varied from 8 to

Productivity and Cost of Harvesting
Shift-level and detailed-timing data were used to
determine overall production rates for the skyline
operation, and to assess the impacts of yarding
distance and intermediate supports on yarding
productivity. For shift-level analysis, the yarder was

equipped with a D S R Servis Recorder and a
supplemental shift-level form was completed daily by
all machine operators. The shift-level form collected
specific information about the activities performed that
day (e.g., yarding road worked on that day and reasons
and times of major delays). The faller also completed
a shift-level form to document daily activities for the
falling phase. These data were compiled to calculate
availabilities, productivities and costs for the faller and
machines used in this operation.
Twenty-four yarding corridors, representing each of
the rigging methods, were selected according to
criteria presented by Howard (1988 and 1989), to
obtain representative detailed-timing information for
single- and multi-span yarding. On the corridors selected,
more than 800 yarding cycles (turns) and associated
delays were detailed-timed using a hand-held
datalogger. For purposes of analysis, the dependent
variable was total delay-free cycle time, and the
independent variables were slope yarding distance,
lateral yarding distance and number of logs per tum.
For safety reasons, the volume per tum could not be
measured at the landing during logging operations, so
the number of logs per tum was chosen as a substitute
independent variable. A n average tum volume was
estimated by multiplying the average number of logs
per tum by the average piece volume (from shift-level
data and final scaled volumes).

Each harvesting cycle was divided into the following
cycle elements: outhaul, lateral out, hookup, lateral in,
inhaul and unhook. See Appendix I for definitions of
these cycle elements.
The detailed-timing data were analyzed using multiple
regression techniques. The relationship between total
cycle time and each independent variable was estimated,
and a complete model, including all terms, was written
for the data. A 0.05 significance level was used to test
the relationship and the contribution each term made
to the model. The model was reduced using the
elimination technique until every independent variable
retained was significant. As a final check, a lack of fit
test was performed by plotting the residuals. Separate
productivity equations were developed for single- and
multi-span yarding.
System productivities expressed as volume of timber
yarded per hour (m%) and cost per cubic metre ($/m^)
were derived based on shift-level data. Productivity in
mVSMH (scheduled machine hour) was determined for
each phase based on volume harvested and time spent
by the faller and each machine in the yarded area. Time
distributions showing productive time, time spent for
maintenance, moving machine and rigging (for yarder),
and delays, were developed for all machines and for the
faller. Hourly machine costs were calculated using
FERIC's standard costing methodology (Appendix II),

and labour costs were calculated using applicable
coastal IWA labour rates. These costs do not include
supervision, profit, overhead or crew transportation,
and do not reflect the actual costs incurred by the company.
Costs for block layout and engineering were estimated
from information supplied by the licensee.' They do
not include supervision costs, and do not include all
costs of getting approvals and other paperwork
accomplished.

Impact of the Operation on Stand and Site
Plot centres established for the operational timber
cruise were relocated and permanently marked in the
field. These plots were uniformly distributed throughout
the cable-yarding treatment unit (systematic sampling),
at a density of approximately one plot per hectare.
Within the plots, sample trees were selected with a
prism to determine removal level by basal area and
to compare it with the original prescription (PPS Probability Proportional to Size). The intensity of the
cut was also assessed with respect to total volume harvested from the cutblock.
The same plots were used to assess site and stand
conditions. Assessment of tree injuries (wounds,
gouges, etc.) conformed to the standards described in
the Tree Wounding and Decay Guidebook ( B C M O F ;
B C Environment 1997) and assumed the stand
management objective for the smdy block is long-term
retention. Therefore, a tree was considered not acceptable
as a residual crop tree i f it met or exceeded the
following limits:
• a wound that girdled more than a third of the stem
circumference
• a wound exceeding 400 cm^ on the stem
• a wound on a supporting root within 1 m of the
stem
• a gouge in the stem
Post-harvest soil disturbance was assessed by locating
two 15-m transects at each plot centre. A random
bearing was selected for the first transect and the
second one was oriented at 90° to the first. Soil
disturbance was sampled at 1-m intervals along each
transect line. Each sample point was classified as either
dismrbed or undisturbed, and surface condition was
recorded. A point was considered disturbed if the litter
was scuffed or i f the mineral soil was exposed by
yarding or falling activities; otherwise, it was recorded
as undisturbed.

Finally, to supplement information about all phases of
the logging process, including rigging of backspars and
intermediate supports, FERIC videotaped the harvesting
operations periodically.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Kitwanga Lumber C o . L t d . began harvesting the
study site in late May 1997. The harvesting operation
continued without intermption throughout the summer
and fall, until completion at the beginning of October.
Generally favourable weather and higher-thanexpected machine availability and production during
the study period shortened the harvesting operation
significantly from initial forecasts.

Shift-Level Productivity
The total volume harvested from the cable-yarded area
was 9650 m^ A summary of productivity parameters

they worked only 7 h/day.
The faller did not have a rigid daily schedule. Shift length
ranged from 6.5 to 9 h/day on the cutblock and averaged 7.5 h/day in the cable-yarded area. The faller felled
corridors, road rights-of-way, and some of the small
clearcuts in the upper part of the cutblock.

Figure 11. Cycle time distribution: multi-span yarding.

For single-span yarding, hookup and unhook were the
most time-consuming elements, each accounting for
25% of delay-free cycle time. For multi-span yarding,
inhaul took a larger proportion of cycle time because
external yarding distances were longer, and more care
was required to pull the carriage over intermediate
supports to ensure the skyline did not jump off the jack.
The cycle elements "lateral out", "lateral in", "hookup"
and "unhook" had similar values for both rigging
configurations. Delays accounted for a larger
proportion of total cycle time in single-span than in
multi-span operation, although the reason is not clear.

Figures 12 and 13 show that as yarding distance
increases, productivity decreases faster for multi-span
than single-span yarding. Also, when multi-span
yarding, the influence of lateral yarding distance
decreases as slope yarding distance increases, because
phases related to lateral yarding (lateral out, hookup,
lateral in) take a smaller proportion of total cycle
time, and outhaul and inhaul become more timeconsuming.

productivity is similar for both systems for short slope
yarding distances. However, as slope yarding distance
increases (up to the maximum distance feasible for
single-span yarding), productivity is higher for singlespan than for multi-span yarding.

where:
CycleTime = Total delay-free cycle time (min)
SlopeDist = Slope yarding distance (m)
LatDist = Lateral yarding distance (m)

Removal Levels

R^ = Coefficient of multiple determination

Based on measurement of the original cmise plots, the
average removal level with respect to basal area was
33%. Comparing the actual volume harvested (9650 m^)
to the initial volume estimated for the stand (25 620 m^)
yields a removal level of 38% by volume. Because the
volume to be removed was calculated using a larger
sample of cmise plots than the one used to estimate
basal area removal after harvesting, it is concluded that
the actual intensity of the cut was 38%, which
corresponds to the silvicultural prescription (target
removal of 40%).

SEE = Standard error of the estimate
Based on these equations, Figures 12 and 13 present
system productivity for single- and multi-span
configurations, respectively, as a function of slope and
lateral yarding distances, based on 8-hour shifts,
including delays. The average log size (calculated from
total piece counts and scaled volume) was 0.47 m^ and
average number of logs per mm was 3.4, yielding an
estimated average mm size of 1.6 m^.

Results for Site and Stand Damage

27 trees/ha (5.4% of residual stand) were wounded.
Most damage occurred by the hauling roads and close
to yarding corridors.

A n attempt was made to evaluate stand damage after
falling. For safety reasons this was rarely possible, but
limited visual evaluation suggests that falling damage
was negligible. Stand damage after yarding is summarized
in Table 6.

A survey of soil surface conditions showed that this
operation caused mirumal soil dismrbance. Only 1.5%
of points analyzed were recorded as dismrbed; of these,
1 % represented dismrbance in the organic layer only
and 0.5% represented shallow disturbance into mineral
soil. The survey found no potentially detrimental site
dismrbance in the cable-yarded area.

The residual stand had a density of 500 trees/ha. Results
showed that 12 trees/ha (2.4% of residual stand) had
wounds that made them unacceptable as residual crop
trees. When considering all wounds regardless of size,

g r o u n d profiles are necessary t o locate slope breaks

where the intermediate supports w i l l be needed.
Experienced people are required to identify adequate
intermediate support and backspar trees in terms of
size and location, and to ensure there are adequate
guyline stomps before roads, landings and yarding
corridors are finalized. During the falling of the unit,
good communication with the fallers is needed so that
the required support trees remain standing.

However, for yarding distances longer than 300 m, the
carriage had difficulty pulling slack. According to the
technical specifications provided by the manufactorer,
for the mainline used, the carriage should be able to pull
slack at distances of greater than 700 m. Since the pads
used on the carriage were almost new, the probable
explanation for this problem was the overall wear of the
carriage.

Using intermediate supports requires more planning
effort, implies greater risk due to the chance of a
support failure, and produces slightly longer road
change times. However, in the right circumstances, it
may reduce the total cost of harvesting by:

Although not encountered in this stody, in general when
performing partial cuts, some downtime could be expected
because of wind. This can happen because it is hazardous
for crews to work under standing trees that may have
broken branches caught in their crowns.

• reducing the amount of road needed to log a
cutblock

One of the most important problems in harvest design
is optimal spacing of haul roads, landings and, in partial
cuts, yarding corridors. Important contributions to
solving this problem were made by Matthews (1942) and
Peters (1978), who attempted to develop a generaUzed
solution. Sessions and L i (1987) presented the principles
of optimizing road and landing spacing by using
computer programs. With respect to spacing of yarding
corridors, McNeel and Young (1994), Rutherford (1996)
and Howard et al. (1996) have developed models specific
to stands and sites in British Columbia, which predict
optimal spacing from measurable stand and machine
characteristics. Although this knowledge exists, it was
not used in this trial to optimize corridor spacing, and in
general is not considered when designing cable partial
cuts. Forest engineers may not be aware of the existence
of these models, or the models may not be presented in
ways that are easy to apply even i f the supporting
research was performed to a high academic standard.
Finally, in this particular trial, the spacing of yarding
corridors was probably influenced more by the need to
meet the visual, recreational, silvicultoral and economic
objectives for the site than to optimize yarding
productivity. Cost savings might have been obtained by
spacing skyline corridors according to these models, but
these benefits would have to be weighed against the
impacts of such changes on other management
objectives.

• improving skyline deflection on difficult yarding
roads
• increasing torn payloads by dividing a long span
into two or more shorter spans
• reducing the time required to yard a given setting
by increasing average payloads
• offsetting the extra time required to rig an
intermediate support, by reducing the number of
machine moves and rig-ups on a given cutblock
In this stody, the use of intermediate supports on six
long yarding corridors improved skyline deflection
and increased the area harvested firom the cutblock's
road system. Additional roads and landings would
have been required to develop the same total area if
only single-span yarding had been used. In addition
to these features, it was observed that multi-span
yarding provided additional control of the torn by
limiting the lateral excursion of the skyline in the
corridor, and thus reduced damage to the residual stand.
Multi-span yarding generally works best when the
skyline is kept relatively tight (i.e., in the range of 5-8%
deflection). This is especially important if there is a sharp
break in the slope of the skyline path at the intermediate
support, or if the intermediate support is relatively
close to the yarder If the skyline is not kept tight enough,
excess slack accumulates in the lower span and the
carriage tends to be pulled under the intermediate
support during inhaul. The Mini-Maki II carriage used
in this stody was designed to minimize this tendency
and therefore was a good choice for this operation.

At the beginning of the operation, the loader had to
travel long distances between landings and different
decks of logs to be loaded. In the second part of the
cutblock, landings and piles were close and the work
available was insufficient for the loader's capacity.
Overall, the loader was under-utilized in this operation
and could have handled a larger volume. However, it was
a necessary component of the system and had to be
available during the yarding operation.

CONCLUSIONS

As this study demonstrated, multi-span yarding has
several advantages, and in the right circumstances
it may overcome many environmental and physical
constraints to logging and achieve acceptable harvest
costs.

In the summer and fall of 1997, F E R I C monitored a
partial cut in the I C H biogeoclimatic zone, near
Kitwanga, B . C . Partial cutting was prescribed for
the study site to address visual, recreational and
silvicultural objectives.

In general, for altemative silvicultural systems, the
overall cost (harvesting and regeneration) may be
lowered if free-to-grow standards can be met earUer and
at less cost; however, the loss of the residual stand
volume, additional supervision requirements, and
higher engineering costs must also be included in the
equation. Long-term assessment of windthrow
occurtence and regeneration success will answer some
of the remaining questions about the applicability of this
silviculmral system in the ICH biogeoclimatic zone.

The cutblock was manually felled and yarded with a
Skylead C40 16000 yarder. The yarding pattern
consisted of parallel 10-m-wide yarding corridors, spaced
approximately 50 m apart and oriented perpendicular
to the contours. Yarding corridors ranged from 40 to
420 m in length and required rigging both in singleand multi-span configurations. The removal level
specified in the Silviculture Prescription was 40% of
basal area; the actual reduction achieved was 38%.
Although the crew was not experienced in partial cutting,
the members were motivated and interested in
obtaining new skills. Good supervision and communication, and good operating conditions also contributed to a successful operation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Effective engineering (layout and load path analysis)
is critical to ensure good yarding performance with
cable systems. During the study. Corridor 51 had to be
abandoned because the intermediate support tree was
unsuitable for the expected loading. Consequently,
lateral yarding distance on Corridors 50 and 52 had to
be extended, adversely affecting yarder productivity. It
is recommended that field engineers have adequate
training in the selection and marking of intermediate
support trees for multi-span cable systems.

Falling productivity was 99 mVshift and yarding
productivity was 102 mVshift. The total cost for falling,
yarding, processing and loading was $32.95/m^. The
engineering cost was estimated at $3.23/m^ for a total
cost of $36.18/m^ Productivity functions were
developed for the yarder, in both configurations, and a
procedure for extrapolating results obtained in this
study for other partial cuts was developed.

As falling in partial cutting operations can present
more risk of hangups and demand more skill in stem
placement, it is recommended that fallers should:

Operationally, falling is the most critical phase because
the placement of stems directly affects yarding
productivity and leave-tree damage. Overall, this study
confirmed that it is essential to have a logging plan that
considers all factors including backspar and landing
locations, falling pattem and direction, location and
loadpath analysis for yarding corridors, and other
natural resource values. During cutblock design, the
size, strength, vigour and species of backspars and
tailhold trees must be considered. Clearly defined
silvicultural objectives for locating skyline corridors
and lateral rows are necessary to minimize the impact
of harvesting on stand structure while maximizing
economic retums.

• be well experienced with clearcutting before being
exposed to partial cutting
• receive additional training on the principles of
partial cutting with emphasis on silvicultural
prescriptions, prevention of hangups and residual
stand damage, and on the implications of good
stem alignment for the safety and productivity of
the subsequent yarding phase
To minimize yarding delays and residual stand damage,
good carriage control when passing intermediate
supports and precise carriage positioning when
initiating lateral yarding are critical. Therefore, the
rigging crew must have the ability and equipment to
communicate effectively.

Post-harvest survey showed that 5.4% of the residual
stand was damaged by logging, and the impact of
the operation on the site was negligible. Visual
impact of the harvest was evaluated as well; the block
was not visible from the highway. Narrow yarding
corridors combined with an all-aged selection
harvest meant canopy textures blended and the forest
cover was maintained.

Effective utilization of the loader during the operation
is important to ensure that the landing is clear and safe,
and that tmcks are loaded with minimum delay.

Appendix III
Procedure for Using Results Obtained in this Study to Calculate Yarding Productivity and
Cost for other Partial Cutting Operations
The productivity equations developed in this paper are specific to the block studied. However, with appropriate
caution, these equations can be used as a guide to estimate productivities for other yarding operations in similar site
and stand conditions. The steps to be taken are presented below:
1. Choose the appropriate productivity equation, i.e., single- or multi-span yarding. If both methods are to be
used, areas for each method should be calculated and each function used for its respective area.
2. Define the stand and site variables:
• average external yarding distance
• average lateral yarding distance
• average number of logs per mm
• average volume per log
3. Compute the mean time per tum (minutes).
4. Compute theoretical productivity per hour, by converting torn time to hours and multiplying by the volume
per mm.
5. Compute acmal productivity by adjusting for in-cycle delays.
6. Calculate theoretical productivity per shift by multiplying the value obtained at Step 5 by shift length.
7. Calculate actual productivity per shift by applying coefficients for yarder availability and utilization.
Based on these values and on the machine cost, the time necessary for the yarder to harvest the site and the cost of
the operation can be estimated.
Care should be exercised not to use the productivity equations outside the ranges for which they were developed,
and when choosing the various coefficients (proportion of in-cycle delays, yarder availability and utilization) required
by this procedure.
