Evaluation of a Trans-Gesco TG 88
clambunk skidder working in
northwestern British Columbia
Abstract

During the fall of 1999, the Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada (FERIC)
performed a short-term study on a Trans-Gesco TG 88 clambunk skidder working near
Terrace in northwestern British Columbia. The study provided information about the
skidder’s productivity and cost. Production functions were derived to predict skidder
performance over a range of operating conditions.

Introduction
Forest management objectives and
practices in western Canada are changing
rapidly to place stronger emphasis on
environmental protection, and new operational
strategies aimed at minimizing soil disturbance
are being developed, tested, and introduced.
They include flexible harvest scheduling to take
advantage of dry weather or frozen ground;
using designated skid trails instead of unrestricted
skidding; substituting low ground pressure
skidders for conventional skidding equipment;
and changing harvesting systems (e.g.,
substituting loader-forwarding for conventional
skidding).1 For successful implementation of
new strategies and technologies, however,
reliable information about their effectiveness
and cost is necessary. To address this need,
FERIC conducts an ongoing program in
western Canada that monitors and reports on
trials of alternative harvesting strategies aimed
at minimizing soil disturbance.
One promising method suitable for
harvesting sensitive sites is the clambunk
system. Because of their track and wheel

systems, clambunks can operate on weaker
soils than conventional rubber-tired and track
skidders. Clambunks travel over a portion
of the skidding distance with only a partial
payload due to their loading sequence. With
proper planning and supervision, the partially
loaded portion of the cycle can be matched
to the weaker soils, thus reducing the ground
impact. Clambunks do very little turning
compared to conventional skidders, so they
are not limited by the same slope constraints.
Furthermore, the weight of the load bears
down on the machines and improves their
stability. Clambunks can be operated safely
on slopes up to 60% (MacDonald 1999).
In 1999, Skeena Cellulose Inc., Terrace
Operations (SCI), undertook a trial to
investigate the feasibility of using a clambunk
skidder to harvest a portion of a cutblock
that was orginally laid out exclusively for cable
yarding. SCI uses cable yarding systems

to extract stems from the falling site to the roadside or
skid trail. Also referred to as excavator-forwarding,
hoe-forwarding, hoe-chucking, or shovel logging.

extensively because of the generally steep and
broken terrain in its operating area. However,
portions of many of its cable cutblocks are
potentially suitable for skidding with
clambunk skidders. These sites represent
opportunities to reduce overall harvesting
costs by substituting lower-cost ground-based
systems for cable systems. FERIC monitored
the trial, which took place on a clearcut
block in the Kiteen River watershed from
August to October 1999. This report
presents the results of the trial.

Objectives
The primary goal of this study was to
assess the economic and operational feasibility

of using a clambunk to skid timber over long
distances in a steep, clearcut block. The
following specific objectives were established
to address this goal:
• Determine overall productivities and
costs for the falling, bunching, skidding,
processing and loading phases of the
harvesting operation.
• Identify factors that influence productivity
and cost of the skidding operation.
• Develop productivity and cost functions
for the skidding phase.
• Identify operational factors affecting
performance of the harvesting system,
and recommend improvements where
appropriate.
• Evaluate the clambunk performance as a
component of a “hot logging” system.2
• Examine financial consequences of using
the clambunk in a block designated
initially for cable yarding.
• Determine the proportion of area disturbed
by skidding and loader-forwarding
activities.

extraction with a clambunk skidder. Long
skidding distances and frequent slope breaks
and steep pitches favoured the clambunk
skidder over other ground-based options such
as loader-forwarders or conventional skidders.
The use of the clambunk eliminated a
planned 1 170-m spur road and the need
for backspar trails along the east and south
boundaries of the block.

Harvesting system
and equipment
The 54-ha block was manually clear-felled
before the yarding and skidding phases
started. No delimbing or bucking was done
at the stump, except for very large trees. The
steeper portion of the block, consisting of
about 33 ha, was harvested with a Madill 123
swing yarder. It was teamed with an MDI/
Yutani MD320 loader used as a backspar, and
a Link-Belt LS-4300 hydraulic log loader. The
remaining area, about 21 ha, was harvested with
a Trans-Gesco TG 88 clambunk (Figure 2).
Two hydraulic log loaders assisted the

cleared the unloading area, spread the stems
on the road for manual processing, sorted
the logs, and loaded trucks.
The Trans-Gesco TG-88 is an 8-wheeldrive, rubber-tired, double-bogie clambunk
designed to skid large loads of tree-length
stems over long distances (Figure 3). It is
10.52 m long and 3.6 m wide, has a 5.66-m
wheelbase and 0.86 m of ground clearance,
and has an operating weight of approximately
29 320 kg with basic equipment. It is
powered by a 246-kW diesel engine and
driven by a hydrostatic transmission and four
hydrostatic pumps that power each tandem
wheel set. The hydraulic system for the
loader, grapple, steering, front blade and
clambunk grapple is powered by two load
sensing pumps. The clambunk is fitted with
a knuckle-boom loader with Trans-Gesco
grapple and Rotobec rotator. The loader has
a maximum reach of 7.6 m, and a lifting
capacity of 2495 kg at a distance of 6.1 m.
The hydraulically operated clambunk has a
cross-sectional area of 3.53 m², a maximum
opening of 4.19 m, and maximum load
capacity of 31 750 kg.
The cutblock was originally laid out for
cable yarding only and most of the road
system was located on steep slopes. As a
result, the clambunk could access ground
skidding areas at only a few locations along
the road, where the road cutbanks were low
and gentle enough for the clambunk to climb.
These locations effectively served as the
landing areas for the clambunk. Logs were
unloaded from the clambunk at these nodes
and then sorted, processed, decked and loaded
onto log trucks by the hydraulic log loader.

In the typical skidding cycle observed in this
study, the clambunk travelled in reverse from
the roadside to the furthest point of the
skidding cycle. Travelling in reverse eliminated
the need to turn the machine around at either
end of its trip. The operator faced the rear of
the machine, and looked over his shoulder
when the machine travelled forward—the low
travel speed made this workable.
The clambunk built its full payload in
stages from several smaller piles. At the first
loading site (the most distant point from the
landing), the butt ends of the stems were lifted
with the loading boom and dropped into the
open clambunk grapple. When all stems
within the reach of the boom had been
loaded, the clambunk grapple was tightened
to secure the load, the machine drove in the
direction of the landing, and then stopped at
the next loading site. This loading process
was repeated until a full load had been
accumulated. The clambunk then skidded
the entire load the remaining distance to the
roadside landing. The direction of all loaded
travel was favourable (downhill). At the
landing, five unloading modes were used:
• Dropping the load by opening the
grapple and driving forward and out
from under the load.
• Unload with the clambunk’s own loading
boom.
• Unload with the hydraulic log loader.
• Unload with both clambunk loading
boom and hydraulic log loader.
• Unload initially by dropping the load
and then with the clambunk’s boom.
To minimize soil disturbance and
facilitate the loading phase of the skidding
operation, the John Deere loader-forwarder
assisted the clambunk by retrieving stems
from the areas located between the trails. The
loader-forwarder bunched the stems in
continuous windrows along the skid trails,
forming a herringbone pattern (Figure 4).
Occasionally, the loader-forwarder helped the
clambunk to load large stems (Figure 5). The
Link-Belt log loader worked on the landing
(Figure 6) and frequently helped unload the
clambunk. On the landing, the skidded

Study methods
During the trial, FERIC and SCI
representatives observed the harvesting
operations and collected time and production
information for the skidding phase. The field
study involved collecting shift-level data,
detail-timing the skidding operation, and
gathering information on numbers of extracted
stems and skidding cycles.
The shift-level data were collected daily
and were complemented with the contractor’s
monthly work reports which documented
shift times for all components of the harvesting
operation. Net volumes of produced logs
were obtained from the monthly weigh-scale
records provided by SCI. Productivities were
calculated for each harvesting phase based on
net harvest volumes and total scheduled
machine hours (SMH) for each phase.
Skidding cycles were detail-timed at
frequent intervals throughout the study
period. Each timed skidding cycle was
subdivided into five timing elements:
travelling unloaded; loading and moving to
load; travelling fully loaded; unloading; and
in-cycle delays (see Appendix I for definitions
of timing elements). Additional data recorded
for each cycle were travelling distances unloaded
and fully loaded, number of stems per cycle,
average slope of the skid trail, mode of
unloading, and reasons for observed delays.
The detailed-timing data were analyzed
using multiple regression techniques to
determine relationships between total cycle
time and skidding distances, slope of the
skidding trail, and number of stems per turn.
A .05 significance level was used to test the
relationship and the contribution each
independent variable made to the model. The
results of the regression analysis were then
used to develop equations to predict delay-free
cycle time and to derive production functions.
Production functions in this report were
developed to predict hourly skidding
productivity, unit skidding cost, and total

unit cost for the Trans-Gesco harvesting
system. Production functions for the skidding
phase were derived by using an average
payload per cycle, and adjusting predicted
cycle times to reflect both in-cycle and
shift-level delays encountered in the skidding
phase. Costs for the loader-forwarding,
skidding, processing and yarding phases were
calculated using FERIC’s standard costing
methods (Appendix II). Labour costs were
based on Industrial Wood and Allied Workers
of Canada rates. Information on falling unit
costs, road construction costs, productivity
for the grapple yarding operation, and
post-harvest rehabilitation costs was supplied
by SCI.

Following harvesting, a survey was
conducted on a portion of the clambunkskidded area to estimate the level of soil
disturbance caused by clambunk and loaderforwarder trails.3 Areas occupied by clambunk
and loader-forwarder trails were determined
by surveying all visible trails. For the purpose
of FERIC’s survey, skid trail segments were
visually classified into one of three classes:
• First-class trails: Unbladed skid trails
ending at the roadside landings and
showing evidence of high levels of machine
traffic, including extensive compaction,
churning and/or exposure of mineral
soil, and well-defined track ruts. From
observations made during the detailedtiming phase, the typical first-class trail
was estimated to have received from 15
to 25 passes by the clambunk. These
trails correspond to “compacted areas”
under the Forest Practices Code (FPC)
(BCMOF 2000).
• Second-class trails: Unbladed skid trails
characterized by extensive but
discontinuous patches of exposed
mineral soil and/or well-defined track
impressions in crushed slash or litter

layers. Second-class trails were usually less
heavily travelled extensions of first-class
trails, but still showed evidence of several
machine passes. These trails were estimated
to have received from 6 to 10 machine
passes on average. Most of the second-class
skid trails would meet the definition of
“dispersed disturbance” under the FPC.
• Third-class trails: Lightly travelled trail
segments characterized by occasional
isolated patches of exposed mineral soil
or other evidence of machine travel (e.g.,
track marks on the forest floor or slash).
Third-class trails were estimated to have
received from 1 to 3 machine passes.
Most of these trails were used exclusively
by the loader-forwarder. Except for
isolated gouges or scrapes, third-class
skid trails would not meet the definition
of “dispersed disturbance”.
For each trail segment, the dimensions
(slope distance, width, and slope gradient) and
traffic intensity were assessed and recorded. As
an added check on the visual traffic intensity
classification, the proportion of exposed
mineral soil was estimated and recorded (to the
nearest 5%) for each trail segment.

Results and discussion
Shift-level study

Skidding
The clambunk was scheduled to work
one 12-h shift per day (except 9.5 h on Fridays),
six days per week. During the monitoring
period, 25 productive shifts were recorded.
The shift lengths ranged from 6 to 13 h, and
averaged 9.9 h.
Shift structure and productivities
summarized in Table 2 are based on the
contractor’s monthly work reports. Overall,
the skidding productivity was 42.7 m³/SMH,
at a cost of $3.86/m³.

For this period, the clambunk’s utilization
and availability were 77% and 85%, respectively.
Half of the delays were caused by mechanical
problems related to hydraulic components.4
No delays related to an interaction between
skidding and yarding operations were observed.

All phases of the Trans-Gesco system
achieved similar productivities except for
processing (Figure 7). Small differences in
productivities resulted mainly from differing
utilizations. Processing productivity per
bucker of 24 m³/SMH was far below the
skidding and loading productivities. Therefore,
two buckers were employed to keep pace with

Overall costs for falling, loader-forwarding,
skidding, processing, and loading were
estimated at $16.15/m³ (Figure 8).
Detailed-timing study:
Trans-Gesco clambunk

Results of the detailed-timing study are
summarized in Table 5. Using the average
net piece volume of 1.52 m³ from the shiftlevel study, 3 616 m³ were skidded in 69.9
PMH, or 51.7 m³/PMH. Figure 9 presents
the distribution of cycle time for the
clambunk. “Loading and moving to load”
was the longest element of the skidding
cycle, accounting for 13.3 min/cycle.
Timing results for the unloading phase
are summarized in Table 6. The unloading
times differed significantly for the five
unloading methods. “Open clambunk and
drive forward to drop the load” was the
fastest unloading technique, but it left the
stems somewhat tangled for subsequent
processing. Unloading with the clambunk’s
boom was the most time-consuming method.
Cycle time, productivity, and cost
of skidding

Multiple regression analysis was performed
on 101 detail-timed cycles. The analysis
found a significant linear relationship between
delay-free cycle time for the Trans-Gesco
clambunk and the variables of travelling
empty distance and number of stems per
cycle (Equation 1, Appendix III). Travel fully
loaded distance and unloading method were
not significant variables.
Figure 10 presents predicted delay-free
cycle time for the clambunk as a function of
skidding distance and number of stems per
cycle. Both variables have a strong impact
on cycle time. For example, cycle time increases
by 8 min as the number of stems per load
increases from 20 to 40. For a skidding
distance of 236 m (the average for this study),
this represents a 25% increase in cycle time.
The impact of the number of stems per load
is even greater for shorter skidding distances.

No significant differences between means at α=.05.

For a payload of 19.7 stems per cycle (also
the average in this study), doubling skidding
distance from 250 to 500 m results in a 50%
increase in cycle time.
The shift-level and detailed-timing results
were combined to estimate productivity
during scheduled skidding time (Equation
2, Appendix III). This can be used to predict
wood flow and schedule processing and
hauling activities on a shift-level basis.
Since the payload volumes skidded by
the clambunk in each cycle were consistent and
reasonably close to the study’s average volume
of 30 m³/cycle, the predicted productivity
was developed as a function of the average
stem volumes. Four classes were arbitrarily
chosen for the average stem volumes: 0.75, 1.00,
1.50, and 2.00 m³. For a payload of
30 m³/cycle, the chosen volumes corresponded
to 40, 30, 20, and 15 stems/cycle.

Figure 11 shows predicted skidding
productivity for the clambunk as a function
of skidding distance and payload size
(number of stems per cycle or, interchangeably,
average stem volume). Because of the relatively
low travel speed of the clambunk and high
proportion of time for loading and unloading
phases, the productivity is very sensitive to
skidding distances and average stem volumes.

from 200 to 400 m results, depending on
the average stem volume, in a 25–32%
reduction of the skidding productivity. For
all skidding distances, productivity increases
as the average stem volume increases. This
effect is especially apparent for short
skidding distances.
For the values recorded in this study,
Equation 2, Appendix III predicts a
skidding productivity of 41.7 m³/SMH.
This agrees well with the average skidding
productivity of 42.7 m³/SMH from the
shift-level study (Table 2).

the Trans-Gesco clambunk as a function of

Skidding and cable yarding
compared to cable yarding only

The use of the clambunk system to harvest
a portion of a cutblock that was initially
designed for cable yarding results in changes
to the equipment complement, redistribution
of the harvest volume between extraction
modes, time to complete harvesting operations,
and length of required haul roads. Some of
these changes have the potential to reduce
overall harvesting costs (e.g., reduction in

classes, the unit skidding cost increases at a
rate of $0.81/m³ for each 100-m increase in
skidding distance. The predicted unit skidding
cost of $3.95/m³ for the values recorded in
this study is very close to the average cost of
$3.86/m³ calculated for the shift-level study.

road construction), while others have the
potential to increase costs. To evaluate the
financial consequences of these changes, an
analysis was performed for two harvesting
systems: a cable-yarding-only system (as
originally planned); and a clambunk-andyarder system (as observed in this trial). The
following differences between the two
options were assumed:
• The total block volume was distributed
between two extraction systems.
• Using the Trans-Gesco clambunk
eliminated a planned 1170-m spur road.
• An additional loader was required to
align and bunch stems to improve the
efficiency of the skidding operation.
• Skidding productivity exceeded cableyarding productivity, resulting in reduced
loader time and landing operation costs.
• Some skid trails in the portion of the
block extracted with the clambunk had
to be rehabilitated.
• There were no substantial differences in
falling and processing costs between the
two systems.
In the financial analysis, productivities
and costs of the skidding system were based
on the shift-level study results. Information
on road construction costs, yarding
productivities, and post-harvest rehabilitation
cost was supplied by SCI. The results of the
analysis are summarized in Appendix IV.
The use of the clambunk system resulted
in a new volume distribution between both
systems and in a substantial saving of $70,000
on road construction. Skidding of 10 536 m³
reduced the cable-yarded volume from
30 037 to 19 501 m³. Because the skidding
productivity was much greater than yarding
productivity, the total extraction time was
reduced from 1 306 to 1 095 SMH. With
the yarder and backspar costs of $343/SMH,
reduced yarding time resulted in a 38%
yarding cost reduction, from $470,602 to
$290,598. In the clambunk-and-yarder
system, the total hours worked by the two
Link-Belt loaders was only 1 148 SMH,
which was less than 1 306 SMH in the

yarder-only system. It resulted in a cost
reduction of $22,398. The new cost
subcategories emerging with the introduction
of the Trans-Gesco system included skidding
cost of $40,683, bunching cost of $30,350,
and skid trail rehabilitation cost of $3,320.
The sums of the selected cost
subcategories for the yarder-only and
clambunk-and-yarder systems were
$864,078 and $689,029, respectively, so
using the Trans-Gesco clambunk resulted in
a savings of $175,049 or $5.83/m³. Even if
the spur road construction ($70,000) was
considered as a site-specific cost, savings
would be $105,049 or $3.50/m³.
Soil disturbance

After skidding was completed and before
the skid trails were rehabilitated, a 9.33- ha
clambunk-skidded area in the southern part
of the block was surveyed to estimate skid
trail occupancy and soil disturbance levels
(Table 7). This sub-unit was considered
representative of the entire ground-skidded
area.
The clambunk and loader-forwarder
developed a total of 3 906 m (horizontal
distance) of unbladed skid trail to harvest
this unit, for an average of 419 lineal m/ha.
Of this total, 867 m were first-class (heavy
use) trails, 1 841 m were second-class trails,
and 1 198 m were third-class (light use)
trails.
Skid trail widths varied from 3 to 10.7 m
and averaged 4.8 m overall. Average skid trail
width increased with traffic intensity, from
4 m for third-class trails to 4.7 m for secondclass trails, and to 6.2 m for first-class trails.
Most of the third-class trails were probably
made and used only by the loader-forwarder,
since the average width of these trails is
narrower than the Trans-Gesco clambunk
(4.5 m when equipped with 1.37-m-wide
tracks, as in this study).
A total of 1.9 ha, or 20.4% of the
harvested area, was occupied by all classes of
skid trails. First-class trails accounted for
0.54 ha, second-class trails for 0.87 ha, and

third-class trails for 0.49 ha. All of the firstclass trails were heavily disturbed due to
repeated machine traffic. The surfaces of these
skid trails consisted almost entirely of exposed
mineral soil (average 91%), usually heavily
churned and mixed with broken slash and
woody debris, with deep continuous impressions
created by the skidder’s tracks and the
dragging ends of large logs.5
Second-class trails represented a gradient
of disturbance conditions. This ranged from
extensive stretches of exposed and churned
mineral soil suggesting numerous machine
passes, to shallow track impressions in
otherwise intact forest floor indicating only
a few passes. A typical second-class trail
consisted of well-defined track impressions
in crushed slash and forest floor material,
interspersed with discontinuous patches of
exposed mineral soil. While it was obvious
that second-class trails were used for skidding,
overall these trails were much less heavily
disturbed than first-class trails. Exposed
mineral soil averaged only 39%, considerably
less than that of first-class trails.

12

Most of the third-class trails were
thought to have been created by the loaderforwarder as it aligned logs for the clambunk,
and were not used for skidding. For the most
part, these trails were identified by faint track
impressions on slash or forest floor layers.
Exposed mineral soil averaged 14% and
occurred in small, isolated patches at points
where the loader-forwarder changed direction
of travel.
This survey was not done to measure
compliance with the FPC. However, the
skid-trail classes as defined for this study
correspond generally with FPC definitions
of “compacted areas” and “dispersed disturbance”
(BCMOF 2000). First- and second-class
trails occupied 5.8% and 9.3%, respectively,
of the harvested area. In the author’s opinion,
virtually all of the first-class trails and perhaps
three-quarters of the second-class trails
qualify as “compacted area” and “dispersed
5

“Exposed mineral soil” was one of the criteria used in
this study to differentiate between first-, second-, and
third-class skid trails, and is not equivalent to “soil
disturbance” as defined in the FPC.

disturbance”, respectively, while lightlytravelled segments of second-class trails and
all of the third-class trails would not count
as soil disturbance. Thus, total soil disturbance
using FPC definitions is probably about
12–13% of the Net Area to be Reforested
(NAR), whereas the maximum disturbance
level allowed for a site with a moderate to
high soil sensitivity rating is 10%. Although
the clambunk probably exceeded the allowable
limit on this particular sub-unit, this survey
suggests that it should be possible to satisfy
soil disturbance objectives by carefully
planning skidding patterns and subsequently
rehabilitating the heavily-travelled skid trails
after harvesting.6

Conclusions
The study demonstrated that the TransGesco TG 88 clambunk was capable of
working efficiently in a clearcut block designed
initially for cable yarding only. The clambunk
met all basic expectations: it was able to
negotiate steep terrain, build its full payloads
from smaller piles, and skid these payloads
over long distances without a dramatic loss
in production.
The clambunk’s cycle time was strongly
correlated with skidding distances and number
of stems per cycle. The clambunk’s payloads
averaged 20 stems and 30 m³ per cycle, based
on the average volume of 1.5 m³ for this study.
The average skidding productivity was
42.7 m³/SMH, and the skidding cost of
$3.86/m³ constituted 24% of the total cost
to put the logs on the truck (estimated at
$16.15/m³). Repairs to components of the
hydraulic system of the machine were the
main source of all delays.
The clambunk was able to work as part
of a hot logging system. Delays resulting
from the interaction between the clambunk
and other components of the harvesting
system were rare and constituted a very low
portion of the shift time.
The financial analysis showed that the
introduction of the Trans-Gesco system to
the study block resulted in considerable time
and financial savings, up to $5.83/m³.

Results of the soil disturbance survey
suggest that with careful planning and
commitment to rehabilitating heavily travelled
skid trails, the clambunk can meet soil
disturbance objectives in this type of
application.
The use of easily recognized, designated
skid trails facilitated identification and
post-harvest rehabilitation of disturbed areas.

Implementation
During the observed harvesting operation,
FERIC identified conditions for successful
and efficient use of the Trans-Gesco
clambunk:
• The Trans-Gesco clambunk can be
employed in clearcut blocks with slopes
up to 50%.
• Skidding with a clambunk is especially
advantageous in blocks with high
average stem volumes. Skidding
productivity and cost strongly depend
on average stem volumes.
• To build up large loads and to use its
full payload capacity, the clambunk
requires cutblocks with relatively long
distances between roads and block
boundaries.
• To achieve an efficient skidding operation
in manually felled cutblocks, and to
facilitate the loading phase of the skidding
operation, felled trees should be retrieved
from the areas in between the trails with
a loader and bunched along the skid trails
in continuous windrows. Windrowed
timber should be oriented in a “herringbone” arrangement. Stems should be
located close to the skid trail, within the
reach of the clambunk’s boom, and with
butts pointing toward the trail. The angle
between the skid trail and stems should
be in the range of 30–45°. Placing the
stems parallel to the skid trail should be
avoided.
6

The FPC allows soil disturbance limits to be
temporarily exceeded if certain conditions are met and
the disturbed area is appropriately rehabilitated after
harvesting, as was done in this study (BCMOF 2000).

13

• To avoid unnecessary soil disturbance, a
system of skid trails for the clambunk
should be laid out. Skid trail sections
should be as long as possible, oriented
perpendicular to the contour lines,
connected by gentle curves, and free of
ground obstacles. The location of the
skid trails has to be known to the loader
operator bunching the stems for the
skidding operation. Stumps on the skid
trail and its vicinity should be kept low
to avoid machine hang-ups. After
several passes of the clambunk, the
height of the stumps usually has to be
reduced with a power saw.
• Retrieving and bunching stems along
skid trails should start early enough to
avoid delays resulting from loader and
clambunk interaction. For cutblocks
with limited access to the haul road and
limited landing capacities, a hot logging
system is recommended.
• Unloading the clambunk with a loader
facilitates preliminary sorting of stems,
keeps the landing area clean, and creates
safer working conditions on the landing
for the processing team.
• The loader-forwarder should be utilized
whenever possible. In blocks harvested
with clambunks, the loader-forwarder
can be used to extract timber from the
block area close to the road.
• The Trans-Gesco system can be combined
with a cable yarding system and may
result in considerable financial savings.
With proper planning and layout of
yarding roads, skid trails, and landings,
no delays related to the interaction
between the two extraction systems
should occur. If two or more extraction
systems are employed in the same block,
landing and loading activities of these
systems should be supported with one
hydraulic log loader to increase its
utilization and reduce costs.

14

• Employment of two or more extraction
systems in the same block requires more
elaborate site reconnaissance, planning
and layout because the requirements of
the systems on the shape of the cutblock,
location of roads, falling and extraction
directions, etc. may be in conflict with
each other. Final decisions may be based
on prioritization of extraction systems
or on study results of several possible
solutions.
• Strategic planning is necessary to
determine the long-term capability of
the company to support the Trans-Gesco
system as a substitute for cable systems.
It should identify suitable locations,
timber volumes, and predicted finanical
outcomes for potential employment of
the clambunk. The planning span should
not be shorter than one year but it would
be advantageous if it was equal to the
expected machine life.
