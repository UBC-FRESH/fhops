EVALUATION OF A DENIS D3000
TELESCOPIC LOG PROCESSOR
Darcy W. Moshenko, R.P.F.

Abstract
This study’s objectives were to evaluate the productivity and costs associated with operating a Denis
D3000 telescopic processor, and to test the accuracy
of its length-measuring device. The Denis D3000 is
one of a series of log processors being studied by
the Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada
(FERIC).

The processor, employed by Fletcher Challenge
Canada Limited in the Southern Interior of British
Columbia, was monitored in early 1990. The net
stand volume of the study block was 437.8 m 3/ha
with an average net stem size of 0.53 m 3. Performance was evaluated under two different operating
conditions: while processing roadside decks piled by
a grapple yarder, and while processing hand-felled
right-of-way wood.

Introduction
In recent years, mechanized delimbing and processing have improved the safety and efficiency of
harvesting operations in the Interior of British
Columbia. Interior operations are well suited to
mechanical processing because the timber is generally less than 60 cm in diameter at the butt, and
less than 30 m in length. One log processor that is
designed to operate in timber of this size, as well as
in timber witii butt diameters up to 66 cm, is the
Denis D3000 telescopic boom processor. In early
1990, the Forest Engineering Research Institute of
Canada (FERic) studied the productivity and costs
associated with operating a Denis D3000 telescopic
processor, and tested the accuracy of its lengthmeasuring device.

The Denis D3000, manufactured by Équipements
Denis Inc. in St Hyacinthe, Quebec (with a branch
office in Kamloops, British Columbia), is capable of
delimbing, bucking, measuring, stacking, and sorting
logs in a roadside or landing situation.

Study Method
The evaluation of the Denis D3000 included two
methods of collecting timing data. For the shift-level
study, a DSR Servis recorder was mounted on the
processor to monitor machine activities. The operator was asked to place a recording chart in the
recorder prior to every shift, tally the number of
merchantable stems processed, and note all delays
longer than 10 minutes. The total volume of logs
produced from the block was determined from
millyard weigh-scale returns. From this compiled
information, figures on machine availability, utilization, production, and costs were calculated.
A FERic researcher used a hand-held data logger to
collect timing data, with accuracies to one-himdredth
of a minute (Appendix I). Data concerning butt
classes, species, long-butting,1 and number of logs
per stem were also recorded.
The butt classes were divided into 10-cm increments
(Table 1). These increments made volume estimates
more accurate than if overall volume estimates were
made using one average stem volume for all the
trees in the stand. By measuring a sample of stems

the stem to eliminate defect (e.g. rot, flare, pistol grip, undercut

in each diameter class, down to a 10-cm top, FERic
was able to derive the average volume per stem for
each diameter range. However, these volumes apply
only to areas where the detailed timing occurred,

cutblock before the subsequent felling and yarding
phases commenced. This not only kept the processor
busy, but also assisted the yarding phase by cleaning
up the decking area. Timber one tree length from
the road was directionally felled towards the road,
thus enabling the processor to reach all felled stems.
The stems were then processed (butt first), loaded,
and hauled before the remaining trees were felled
and yarded. Using the D3000 to yard and process
this wood reduced the overall system cost because
the yarder did not handle the wood.

Also, the processor’s length-measuring device was
evaluated for accuracy. The operator processed and
measured a number of logs, then set them aside for
manual measurement before placing them in the log
deck. The manual measurements were then compared to the machine’s target lengths.

Site anti System Description
The study area was located approximately 50 km
east of Kelowna, British Columbia. The block had
a westerly aspect with an average slope of 45% and
a stocking mix of lodgepole pine (attacked by
mountain pine beetle), Engelmann spruce, sub- alpine
fir, western red cedar, Douglas-fir, and western
larch. The timber cruise compilation for the block
identified a net stand volume of 437.8 m 3/ha. Also,
a sample scale carried out by FERic during the
detailed-timing study showed the average stem
volume was 0.53 m 3.

The Denis D3000 has a unique telescopic boom
feature. The main boom tube is powered through the
boom pedestal by a feed chain and drive sprocket
mechanism while a smaller tube section telescopes
inside the main boom by means of double cables
and pulleys. Both boom sections are stroked simultaneously for rapid processing speed. The processing
head is attached to the end of the smaller boom tube
and includes a set of grapple arms with integral
delimbing knives, and fixed front and rear delimbing
knives. A chain saw for bucking and topping completes the set-up. The rear assembly is fixed to the
boom pedestal and includes a larger set of holding
arms; a butt plate; a second, larger, bucking chain
saw (on the 81-cm funnel model); and an Entek
length-measuring system. Figure 2 shows the Denis
D3000 at work in the grapple-yarded wood.

Harvesting on the study block was done by
Armitage Contracting Limited of Armstrong, British
Columbia for Fletcher Challenge Canada Limited.
The operation utilized a Washington 108 grapple
yarder, a Caterpillar D8 mobile backspar, an International TD20 tailhold for the yarder guylines, and
the Denis D3000 telescopic processor mounted on a
Komatsu PC220LC carrier (Figure 1). Loading and
hauling functions were performed by two independent self-loading logging trucks. This system produced approximately 200 m 3/shift.

Operation of the Denis D3000 is similar to that of
other stroke delimbers. The front grapple arms
secure a stem approximately three metres from the
butt then pull it away from the deck towards the
rear assembly. After the stem passes by the elec-

Because the cutblock was felled by hand rather than
by a feller-buncher, the grapple yarder could not
produce sufficient volumes to keep the processor
fully occupied. Consequently, the D3000 was used
to daylight-process2 the right-of-way stems in the

； head is then powered along the stem removing
branches at speeds up to three metres per second
until the minimum top diameter, or a pre-determined
length, is reached. The top portion (waste) is bucked
and dropped in the slash pile. After topping is

slightly and the boom is retracted. The front

were recorded during the study period from February 5 to March 29, 1990; 14 232 stems were
processed, or approximately 8728 m 3 of wood. The
total ownership and operating cost was $91.76/h.
(Costs were derived by FERic and are not the actual
costs incurred by the contractor, see Appendix III).

Shift-Level Study
The Denis D3000 was monitored for 38 productive
shifts over a period of 53 days. The 15 non-productive shifts were weekends (operator off). Right-ofway and yarded wood could not be separated in the
shift-level study; therefore, production figures are
lower and costs are higher than if only yarded wood
had been processed. Discussion with the operator
revealed that relatively short move times from the
yarded decks to right-of-way processing were also
not recorded. Table 2 shows the shift-level results.

Longer stems, comprising two logs, were pushed
partially into the funnel, or tray. The funnel is
located directly behind the rear assembly and prevents the stem from dropping onto the carrier
shrouding. The same topping process as described
earlier occurs, except the boom retracts to a predetermined length. The topping saw then cuts and
drops the short log into the log deck. Finally, the
butt log is retrieved from the funnel and decked.
Occasionally, the delimber handled very large stems
by processing and decking the butt log independently of the remaining log.

Average hourly production for processing the
combination of yarded and right-of-way wood was
47.8 stems/h, or 29.3 m 3/h (total time). The total
processing cost for all the wood in the study block
was determined to be $3.13/m 3 , or $1.92/stem, when
using the hourly machine costs derived in Appendix
III. In addition, machine utilization for the processor
was determined to be 81.7% with an availability of
92.2%. A summary of delays in the shift-level study
is provided in Appendix II.

Long-butting is done with the topping saw, or with
the chain saw mounted on the rear assembly. The
operator preferred not to use the rear bucking saw
because it was more efficient to retrieve the top after
each long-butting cut than to use the rear chain saw
and drop waste near the road and the machine
(Figure 3).

Detailed-Timing Study
Almost 39 h of detailed timing were done randomly
during the shift-level monitoring period. All productive time and delays less than 10 min were considered part of the detailed-timing study. The processing of grapple-yarded wood and right-of-way
wood were timed separately and summarized
(Table 3).

Resute and Discusston
The contractor operated the processor eight hours
per shift, five shifts per week. A total of 38 shifts

Detailed-timing data were collected for the processing of 1780 stems of grapple-yarded wood (or 943
m3). Analysis of these data indicates productivity
was 84.4 stems/h or 44.8 m3/h (productive time). In
comparison, timing analysis of 1142 stems (or 605
m3) of right-of-way wood shows productivity was
64.2 stems/h or 34.0 m3/h (productive time). As a
result, costs for the yarded wood were $2.51/m3 or
$1.33/stem, while costs for the right-of-way wood
were $3.30/m3 or $1.75/stem. All costs associated
with detailed timing assume a machine utilization of
81.7% so that a direct comparison can be made with
the cost results of the shift-level study.
The data were separated to compare the results of
processing yarded wood (decked by the yarder) and
right-of-way wood. Productivity was lower for rightof-way processing because extra time was taken to
sort and deck the logs along the road. Also, more
time was associated with the moving and cleaning
elements. Although it cost an extra $0.79/m3 to
process this wood, it is important to remember there
was no yarding cost.
Although the processing of grapple-yarded decks
was more productive than processing right-of-way
wood, FERic observed two activities that increased
processing time over that which wotild be expected
if the machine was working on a roadside block
harvested by a grapple skidder. Before the processor
could begin work, those stems with butts directed
away from the D3000 had to be turned around, and
decks that were too high had to be broken down.
Although a quantitative timing comparison was not
available, FERic felt productivity increases could
result from consistent butt orientation and lower

Length-Measuring Summary
A total of 50 logs were measured by hand to assess
the length-measuring accuracy of the D3000. Measurements determined that 92% of the processed logs
were within ±7.5 cm of the target length (Table 8).

Table 7. Delay Time: Summary

The four logs that had a high degree of measurement error may have resulted from slippage in the
holding arms or from undercut notches on stump
pulls left by hand-felling. Such butt irregularities
would have caused the computer to start measuring
too soon. Occasionally, the operator cut the jagged
edge off the butt before processing, thus improving
accuracy. At other times, the operator adjusted the
log lengths visually if a jagged butt was present;
small errors may have occurred from this action.

Conclusions

Table 8. Length-Measuring Accuracy

In 1990, FERic evaluated the productivity and costs
associated with operating a Denis D3000 processor,
and the accuracy of its length-measuring device. The
study occurred near Kelowna, British Columbia with
cooperation from Fletcher Challenge Canada
Limited.
The overall productivity of the Denis D3000 was
29.3 m3/h; however, this productivity value also
reflects the other non-processing activities, e.g.
longer moves and decking logs for the yarder. A
productivity of 44.8 m3/h (productive time) was
recorded during the detailed timing of the grappleyarded wood. This figure is significant because it
shows that the Denis D3000 is capable of producing
approximately 38 m3/h (with the test site tree size,
species mix, and utilization of 81.7%), on a shiftlevel basis, if only yarded wood is processed. The
overall processing cost of $3.13/m3 reduces to
$2.51/m3 when analyzed only against the grappleyarded wood.

Interior of British Columbia. The D3000 helps
improve productivity and costs associated with
operating the yarder by allowing tree-length wood to
be brought to roadside. Therefore, the overall system
cost is less than using a yarding system without the
processor.

Because the machine worked in conjunction with a
grapple yarder, productivity of the D3000 was lower
and costs were higher than what would be expected
