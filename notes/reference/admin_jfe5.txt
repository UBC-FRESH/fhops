   Processing: begins when the tree hits the ground, or when the felling head begins to pull the tree
      through the delimbing knives, ends when processing is complete.
   Brushing: removal of saplings and brush and felling of unmerchantable trees.
   Piling: piling or sorting logs in the woods.

Table 4. Activities (and associated terms) in the forwarder time study.


  Travelling empty: begins when the forwarder leaves the landing area, ends when the forwarder stops
     to begin loading or some other task.
  Loading: begins when the forwarder starts to load logs, ends when the boom is rested in a stationary
     position, ready for a machine move.
  Moving between loading: begins when the boom is rested stationary on the bunk, ends when the
     forwarder stops moving.
  Travelling loaded: begins when the boom is rested stationary on the bunk, ends when the forwarder
     stops at the landing area.
  Unloading: begins when the forwarder raises the boom for unloading, ends when the boom is rested
     stationary on the bunk for a return trip to the woods or some other task.
   Sorting: sorting products (sawlogs or pulpwood) in the woods.
  Brushing: clearing brush (limbs and tops) from the bunk.
  Repositioning: movement from one corridor to another while loading in the woods.
  Delays: operational, mechanical, and personal delays that interrupt the normal work activity of the
     forwarder.
  Distance out: the distance travelled by the forwarder from the landing area to the location where
      loading begins.
  Travel in unit: the distance travelled in the unit while in the loading mode.
  Distance in: the distance from the last loading location to the landing area.
  Logs: the number of logs loaded.
  Product: the product of the load (sawlogs, pulpwood, or mixed).

  average load sizes are 9.9 m 3 [350 ft3] for sawlogs, 5.7 m 3 [200 ft3] for pulpwood, and 9.3 m 3 [330 ft3]

       The cost of support equipment for the cut-to-              manoeuvring trailers, as well as on a total cost per
