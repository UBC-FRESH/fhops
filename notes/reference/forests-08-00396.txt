 Abstract: New techniques have recently appeared that can extend the advantages of grapple yarding
 to fast-growing plantations. The most promising technique consists of an excavator-base un-guyed
 yarder equipped with new radio-controlled grapple carriages, fed by another excavator stationed
 on the cut-over. This system is very productive, avoids in-stand traffic, and removes operators
 from positions of high risk. This paper presents the results of a long-term study conducted on
 12 different teams equipped with the new technology, operating in the fast-growing black wattle
 (Acacia mangium Willd) plantations of Sarawak, Malaysia. Data were collected continuously for almost
 8 months and represented 555 shifts, or over 55,000 cycles—each recorded individually. Production,
 utilization, and machine availability were estimated, respectively at: 63 m3 per productive machine
 hour (excluding all delays), 63% and 93%. Regression analysis of experimental data yielded a strong
 productivity forecast model that was highly significant, accounted for 50% of the total variability in
 the dataset and was validated with a non-significant error estimated at less than 1%. The figures
 reported in this study are especially robust, because they were obtained from a long-term study that
 covered multiple teams and accumulated an exceptionally large number of observations.

1. Introduction
     Compared with natural forests, tree plantations offer many benefits, including fast growth,
rationalized management and pre-defined product target [1]. Industrial tree plantations are
characterized by very high yields, which result from the use of selected genotypes under favorable soil
and climate conditions [2]. The fastest growing tree plantations are found in the Southern Hemisphere,
and yield up to 40 m3 of solid wood per hectare per year [3]. As a result, many forest companies in
Europe and North America have transferred their capital away from domestic forest ventures [4] and
towards highly-productive plantations in South America, South Africa, and Australasia [5].
     Plantation forestry has an enormous potential for the efficient supply of fiber and renewable
fuel [6], and may already account for almost half of the global production of industrial wood [7].
In fact, experts estimate that the importance of plantations will continue to grow [8], and that by
2050 75% of the global fiber supply will be sourced from dedicated plantations established on farm
land [9]. In that regard, plantation forestry offers better environmental performances than conventional
agriculture and animal husbandry [10], and is widely acknowledged as a sustainable source of wood

fiber [11]. Despite concerns about potential social impacts [12], plantation forestry does not seem to
imply a loss of jobs compared with traditional agriculture [13], and it may create high quality jobs in
underdeveloped regions [14].
      Ultimately, tree plantations contribute to economic and social development, and help in offsetting
the increased CO2 emission [15] resulting from the rapid development of countries in the Southern
Hemisphere [16]. Of course, the environmental and social benefits of plantation forestry are only
realized if proper management techniques are adopted [17]. That is especially critical for harvesting,
which has the highest potential for impact. Safe, low-impact harvesting should be adopted in all
cases, making use of modern equipment that is specifically designed for this purpose. Today, forestry
equipment manufacturers offer new machines capable of matching the strictest specifications for
environmental performance and safe operation [18]. In particular, operator stations are always
enclosed in protected cabs, which mitigate the consequences of accidents and are designed to minimize
the risk of long-term occupational disease [19].
      Complete mechanization of harvesting work is especially difficult on steep terrain, where
excessive slope gradient prevents stand access to forest vehicles [20]. Under these conditions, operators
generally resort to cable yarding or to building a dense network of skid trails [21]. Unfortunately,
neither solution can guarantee low-impact and safe operation at the same time. Cable logging
configures as a low-impact harvesting technique, but it requires that operators are on the ground,
exposed to serious hazard [22]. On the other hand, opening trail after trail certainly cannot be defined
as low-impact harvesting: in fact, the building of skid trails on steep slopes is a main contributor to
site impact, especially in tropical areas [23].
      There is an urgent need to find cost-effective, low-impact and safe technologies for steep terrain
harvesting, as flat land is monopolized by farming and rural development, and plantations can only
expand to hill country [24]. For instance, experts predict that by 2020 the volume of wood harvested
in New Zealand with cable technology will be larger than the volume harvested with conventional
ground-based equipment [25]. Similarly, loggers in different places such as France [26] and the Pacific
Northwest [27] must now tackle the challenging terrain left behind in the recent past because it was
too steep for low-cost mechanized harvesting with ground-based technology.
      A possible solution is offered by grapple yarders, which offer the typical environmental benefits of
cable extraction while dispensing with manual assistants placed in risk areas [28]. With these machines,
a mechanically-operated grapple clutches the load, removing the need for one or more operators to
station at the loading site and manually hitch the loads with chain or wire slings [29]. Grapple yarders
are not a new development, and their use has been documented since at least the early 1960s [30].
In fact, they were designed for logging old-growth, where loads generally consisted of one large piece.
Landing the grapple on such a big target was relatively easy, and grapple yarders have remained
popular in the Pacific Northwest for as long as big tree logging has been widely accepted [31]. However,
plantation forestry offers much smaller trees, and optimum load size is only achieved when multiple
trees are assembled into the same load, which favors choker slings over grapples [32]. Under these
conditions, grapple yarders are potentially less productive because they move smaller loads or spend
more time to accumulate a large enough load [33]. Fortunately, a new work technique seems able to
recover the handicap and release the full potential of grapple yarding: this consists of detaching a
mid-size excavator to feed the grapple with pre-bunched loads, which dramatically boosts grapple
yarder production [34]. In this configuration, the grapple yarder becomes a very effective system
for logging steep terrain plantations, and may compete successfully with most other options [35].
However, this system is so new that very little information is available on its performance, despite
the large potential and widespread interest. To-date, all available studies on the subject consist of
short-term case studies that cannot be generalized and are not capable of producing an accurate
representation of downtime, as required for long term production estimates [36].
      Therefore, the goal of this study is to produce a general model for the productivity of innovative
grapple yarding techniques in plantation forestry, based on a large number of observations, and

The study covered the extraction of over 125,000 m3 or over 240,000 stems, with total length between
10 and 30 m.

2.3. Data Analysis
      Data were analyzed both at the shift level and at the cycle level. Descriptive statistics were used
for reporting the main results of the study. Then, individual variables were tested for compliance
with the main statistical assumptions for a parametric test. In particular, linearity and normality
were checked by observing residual plots and distribution histograms, respectively. Equality of
variance was checked with Levene’s test. Normal (or normalized) data was tested through the
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the aim of determining the significance and the strength of all
relevant effects—especially machine type, team, distance, and piece size. Eventual differences were
pinned on the specific treatments using Tukey–Kramer’s test. Non-normal data were analyzed using
non-parametric techniques, and treatments were separated using Scheffe’s test, which is particularly
robust to violations of the normality assumption [46]. The significance of any differences between
distributions was checked using classic χ2 (chi-square) analysis.
      Time and productivity data were also analyzed with multiple regression techniques in order
to estimate significant relationships between these variables and other relevant variables. The effect
of categorical data was introduced by generating suitable indicator variables [47]. Validation is a
prerequisite of production models derived from time study data [48], and it was conducted according
to the same procedure recently used by Adebayo et al. [49] and Spinelli et al. [50] for similar modeling
studies. The dataset was partitioned at random into two subsets: the first subset, containing 95% of the
observation number was used to calculate appropriate productivity relationships through regression
analysis; the second subset, with the remaining 5% of the observations (reserved data), was used to
validate the regressions obtained above. To this purpose, the models were used to predict the reserved
data, then a paired t-test was used to check if there were any significant differences between predicted
and observed figures.
      All statistical analyses were conducted with the SAS Statview 5.01 software package (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA), for α < 0.05.

3. Results
     Daily production averaged 226 m3 for a mean shift duration equal to 6.3 h (Table 2). Mean piece
and load size were 0.5 m3 and 2.4 m3 , respectively. Teams commonly worked 2.4 lines per shift, with a
mean length of 103 m and a maximum length of 250 m. That resulted in a mean extraction density of
0.9 m3 per m of line.
     Utilization averaged 63%, with small differences between teams (Table 3). Only team 7 emerged
with a significantly higher utilization rate than the others, reaching 80%. While the erratic nature of
delays made it difficult to find significant differences between the impact of different delay types,
a χ2 analysis of the frequency of delay events showed that team 7 had significantly lower occurrences
of mechanical delay and line change events, pointing at higher mechanical reliability and better
organization of the harvest area as the possible reasons for the better performance of team 7. In fact,
mechanical availability was high for all machines and never went below 89%. As for line change, it is
possible that team 7 performed line changes when the machines were idle for some other reasons,
so that line change time would be covered by some other delay event category. In all cases, the
incidence of personnel delays was relatively high, which was due to the inclusion of the main lunch
break within shift time (Figure 4).

      Slope gradient varied from 23% to 49%, with a mean value of 33%. VRM ranged between 1 (even
terrain) and 3 (moderately rugged terrain), with the average value at 2 (slightly rugged terrain).
Terrain characteristics did not seem to have any strong effects on yarder performance, although there
was some evidence that extraction distance increased with slope gradient and decreased with terrain
ruggedness. This might be related to the practice of moving all trees to the bottom of the slope during
pre-bunching in steep sites, and to the difficulty in getting enough deflection on long lines in rugged
terrain. Data analysis also suggested that the frequency of line changes increased with slope, but the
time required for the change decreased with it, possibly because an increase in the number of lines for
the same harvest implied that the distance between two adjacent lines was shorter, and that made line
change easier and faster. In any case, these relationships were quite weak, which made it difficult to
estimate reliable factors for the effects of slope gradient and terrain ruggedness on line length, line
change frequency, and line change duration.
      The analysis of covariance showed that net work productivity in m3 per productive machine hour
(PMH) was affected by piece size, yarder type (heavy or medium), and by the interaction of piece
size with yarder type. All these effects were significant at the <0.0001 level, for η 2 values of 10%, 1%,
and 1%, respectively.
      The analysis of data indicated that the two yarder types (heavy and medium) were deployed on
different sites, with the heavy yarder handling larger piece sizes than the medium yarder (Table 4).
On the other hand, the latter was able to accumulate a significantly larger number of pieces per load,
resulting in a larger load volume—although that took a longer time. The capacity of medium yarders
to collect more pieces per load was the result of these machines being equipped with wider-opening
grapples than were installed on heavy yarders. Heavy yarders worked longer shifts and had higher
utilization, although the differences were small. Line change was faster for the heavy yarders, likely
because they worked on shorter distances. However, heavy yarders changed lines more often and
the incidence of line change time over total time was the same for both yarder types. Heavy yarders
experienced fewer but longer delay events, with the same outcome of no difference between yarder
types for the incidence of downtime. As expected, productivity was significantly higher for heavy
yarders, as the combined result of stronger winches, faster line speed, larger piece size, and shorter
extraction distance. The productive edge of heavy yarders was 25% and 17%, depending on whether
delays were included or not.

     The net productivity of teams 1, 4, 6, and 8 was between 20% and 30% higher than the grand
average, and the difference was significant. While these differences could partly depend on better
working conditions, they hinted at the effect of operator skills on operation performance. Therefore,
these teams were marked as “top teams”, and the group was tested as an independent variable in
multiple regression analysis, in order to check if the effect of team choice was significant in addition to
the effects of work conditions.
     The model was highly significant, and could explain half of the variability in the data pool
(Table 5). The relationships described by the model were all logical: productivity increased with
piece volume and the number of pieces in a load, and decreased with both line length and stacking
distance. Productivity was lower for the medium yarders, and the difference between the two yarder
types increased with piece size, with heavy yarders performing increasingly better with larger trees,
also because they were fitted with smaller grapples and may have encountered more difficulty when
trying to accumulate many pieces in a single load. Top teams were more productive than the average,
but their margin eroded with piece size, indicating that with a large piece size most operators can
achieve a high productivity, and that skills are truly tested with small pieces rather than with large
ones. The model was successfully validated. Reserved data were predicted with an error of 0.3%, and
the difference between actual and predicted productivity figures was not significant (p = 0.6943).

      distance in m; Medium = indicator variable for medium yarder: if yarder is medium = 1, if heavy = 0; Top = indicator
      variable for top team: if top team = 1, if not = 0.


      The model was used to estimate a break-even piece size between the two yarder types.
The calculation was conducted under the following hypotheses: line length = 100 m, stacking distance
= 20 m, use of a standard team (not a top team), and a number of pieces per load that was found to
be stable at 4.1 for the heavy yarder, and varied according to the following equation for the medium
yarder: n◦ of pieces = 6.88 – 2.73 piece volume in m3 . The graph suggests that heavy yarders should be
preferably deployed on those sites where mean piece volume is larger than 0.6 m3 (Figure 5). Of course,
this is true for medium yarders with a larger grapple than installed on heavy yarders, and it is likely
that the results will change if heavy yarders will also be equipped with a wide-opening grapple.

that is confirmed by the results of the statistical analysis. While data imbalance and various errors may
have weakened the accuracy of the results, the study is still able to determine the effect of the most
important variables that affect productivity, and offers a regression model that is highly significant,
accounts for 50% of the total variability in the dataset, and is validated with a non-significant error
estimated at less than 1%.
      The reference figures presented in this study substantiate recent claims about the very high
productivity of the new grapple yarding system. Such encouraging results confirm the inherent
potential of the new technology, but depend at least in part on the short extraction distance and
the benefits of pre-bunching, which has been shown to increase yarder productivity by more than
30% [33,34]. On the other hand, piece size is much smaller than reported in New Zealand or US
studies, and offers a better representation of black wattle and fast-growing hardwood plantations in
general [60].
      The productivity levels recorded in this study compare quite well with the figures reported
in other previous studies of similar grapple yarders, swing yarders, and excavator-based un-guyed
yarders (Table 6). The closest match is the study by Amishev and Evanson [34], reporting a productivity
of 86 m3 PMH−1 . When the model developed in this study is used to calculate yarder productivity
under the same line length and piece size conditions, the result is 83 and 98 m3 PMH−1 for the medium
and the heavy yarders, respectively. This may support the general validity of our productivity model.

type. Such figures are fully compatible with those reported for Finnish harvester operators by
Ovaskainen et al. [64] and Karha et al. [65], who also indicated a bracket between 20% and 40%.
While it may be difficult to rate operators correctly [66], knowledge of possible variations is important
when assessing between-team variability for planning purposes [67].
      In that regard, it is also important to remark that the team that clearly emerged above all the
others for minimum downtime was not among the teams that were rated as top teams for their high net
productivity and fast work pace. This simple fact suggests that dexterity and good time management
represent different skills, which may not be concurrent within the same team. In fact, any future
upgrades should target time management and utilization rather than net productivity, since the latter
is already in line with any of the documented figures or well above them, whereas utilization and shift
duration are still relatively small and could be improved.
      The model can also discriminate between yarder types, indicating preferential conditions for
yarder type selection. Of course, the differences found with the model are only valid for the specific
machine configurations covered with the study, and may vary if specific improvements were made on
the yarders. That is specifically the case of grapple selection: the better performance of medium yarders
Forests 2017, 8, 396                                                                                           12 of 15



with smaller trees is due at least in part to the wider opening grapple they received, and therefore one
may improve the small-tree performance of heavy yarders by fitting them with a larger grapple.
     However, the model cannot account for the effect of slope gradient and ruggedness, but that
might be due to the relatively small field of variation for both factors rather than to poor model
characteristics. In fact, both slope gradient and terrain ruggedness are somewhat moderate, which is
the condition for effective pre-bunching. On steeper slopes, one may resort to winch-assist technology
for pre-bunching, as it has already been done in other cases [35]. While terrain conditions would be
suitable for the introduction of a complete winch-assist ground-based harvesting system, the need for
minimizing soil impacts suggests sticking with the current grapple yarder system. In this case, a valid
compromise could be reached by introducing a winch-assist feller-buncher to replace manual felling
and separate pre-bunching. This measure may dramatically increase productivity and worker safety.
However, winch-assist ground-based harvesting systems require highly specialized personnel, which
may represent a limiting factor in developing economies [68].

5. Conclusions
     The productivity models estimated in this study are especially robust, because they were obtained
from a long-term study that covered multiple teams and accumulated an exceptionally large number
of observations, as prescribed by the classic canons of model development. The figures and the model
offered in this paper fill an urgent knowledge need, as the new grapple yarding technique is becoming
increasingly popular and attracts growing attention. While gained specifically on one yarder make
and plantation type, the information in this study can be extended to other similar machines and
plantations, because the sheer volume of data allows cautious generalization.
