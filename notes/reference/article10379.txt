           Highlights
       •     The results can be used as a basis to determine in what kinds of cases brushwood biomass
             should be recovered and where it should be left to decay.
       •     The average volume of harvested brushwood and forwarding distance are the key elements
             to harvesting productivity with a harwarder.
       •     Stump diameter has a strong impact on clearing productivity of brushwood.

           Abstract
       Expertise in the cost-efficient utilization and treatment of brushwood on forest roadside sites is
       limited. In the present study, the productivity of brushwood clearing and harvesting on forest
       roadside sites was defined by creating time-consumption models or parameters for the aforemen-
       tioned working methods. Compiled time consumption models and parameters for the brushwood
       clearing and harvesting can be used as a basis for evaluating alternative management practices and
       to determine when brushwood biomass should be harvested and when it should be left to decay.
       The harvesting of brushwood was based on the harwarder system and the clearing of brushwood
       was done with a spiral cutter, which is a novel accessory for cutting roadside vegetation. Based
       on the study results, the average volume of harvested brushwood and forwarding distance are the
       key elements that have an effect on harvesting productivity with harwarders. Correspondingly,
       stump diameter has a strong impact on the clearing productivity of brushwood. The plot-wise
       productivity of the spiral cutter in brushwood clearings varied in the range of 0.19–0.61 ha per
       PMh. An increase in stump diameter slowed down the clearing productivity of the spiral cutter
       and there was a clear step downward in clearing productivity as the average diameter increased
       from 30 mm to 40 mm. The machinery under study operated well and there were no interruptions
       due to machine breakdowns.

1 Introduction

1.1 Background

Finland has approximately 135 000 kilometres of forest roads, most of which have been built from
the 1970s to the 1990s (Kiss et al. 2015; Kaakkurivaara 2018). Typically, the width of the forest
roadway is 4–5 m and the width of road right-of-way (including side slopes and ditches) is 8–12 m
(Uusitalo 2010). Forest roads, which are owned by private forest owners, forest companies or the
state forest service, provide access to harvesting sites and enable the transportation of timber from
forests to mills, railways or floating terminals (Korpilahti 2008; Kiss et al. 2015; Kaakkurivaara
2018). The road network also eases silvicultural operations, recreation, collection of non-wood
products or firefighting and rescue operations (Kiss et al. 2015; Kaakkurivaara 2018; Laschi et al.
2019). The road network needs to be kept in good condition, so that it is able to withstand heavy
timber truck and other vehicles (Coulter et al. 2006; Korpilahti 2008; Pellegrini et al. 2013). On
dry roads, bearing capacity is higher than that of roads that fail to dry out properly (Korpilahti
2008; Kiss et al. 2015; Kaakkurivaara 2018).
       The ditching system plays an important role in the drying of forest roads and overgrown
roadside vegetation (brushwood) can obstruct proper drainage if the woody vegetation growing is
not cleared on a regular basis (Korpilahti 2008; Kiss et al. 2015; Kaakkurivaara 2018). Clearing
cycles and management distances are derived from growing conditions and species; faster growth
requires more attention. Woody vegetation effectively prevent the drainage of side ditches and the
road surface. In addition, it narrows the width of the functional roadway and limits sight distance,
leading to reduced road safety. Such brushwood consists of saplings, bushes and young trees of
a range of deciduous plant species mixed with conifers (Korpilahti 2008; Ebenhard et al. 2017).
Based on the Finnish national forest road quality standards, in the worst case the roadway and sides
are fully covered by brushwood (diameter at 1.3 m height over 5 cm) that it cannot be removed
economically by normal road maintenance, e.g. with rotor or chain mulchers (Korpilahti 2008),
which are attached, e.g. to a tractor, excavator or harvester. With mulchers, the cutting is based on
blunt tools which increase noise and fuel consumption as well as risk of thrown wood splinters
into the surroundings, especially if the brushwood is overgrown.
       Currently, very little of the brushwood overgrowth is utilized for energy in Finland, and it
is almost invariably cut and left to decompose, even if the clearing cost is considerable. The basic
economic advantages of brushwood recovery would be the fact that the cost of harvesting could
be offset by the existing mulching costs and income from the harvested biomass (Iwarsson-Wide
2009b,c). In addition, it could decrease, e.g. the forest road renovation costs of dilapidated roads,
keep the ditches open and improve both the availability and accessibility of forest biomass. Brush-
wood harvesting has also a negative effect on soil fertility, especially on poor sites and when leaves
are also removed from the site, which may restrain coppicing and regrowth (Unrau et al. 2018).
In contrast to brushwood mulching, the productivity (m3 per operating hour) and cost efficiency
(euros per m3) of mechanized harvesting improves with increasing tree size and harvest intensity
(Unrau et al. 2018). Even though the harvesting technologies used in overgrowth brushwood can
be similar to those used in conventional forestry, the harvesting costs can be expected to be dif-
ferent in roadside brushwood clearing with smaller tree sizes, smaller harvesting sites and longer
forwarding driving distances.
       In conventional mechanized thinning, the operator selects the trees to be thinned. In roadside
brushwood harvesting, all biomass from a specific area is harvested systematically, the remain-
ing tree stand do not hamper harvesting and the time used on tree selection can be avoided. The
cost-efficiency of roadside brushwood harvesting is based on the mass handling of small-sized

trees (Unrau et al. 2018). In energy wood harvesting, the most interest has focused on multi-tree
handling with accumulating felling heads and harvester heads (Bergström 2009; Kärhä 2011; Lai-
tila 2012; Erber and Kühmaier 2017; Läspä and Nurmi 2018). With these heads, the operator can
cut and collect multiple trees in the head before processing them and thus increasing productivity
(Bergström 2009; Laitila 2012; Erber and Kühmaier 2017; Läspä and Nurmi 2018). These heads
can be mounted on harvesters, excavators or tractors. A harwarder is a dual purpose machine for
cutting and forwarding and the harwarder head is capable of cutting, accumulating and processing
as well as loading and unloading harvested trees (Laitila and Asikainen 2006; Kärhä 2006; Laitila
2008; Rottensteiner et al. 2008; Iwarsson-Wide 2009c; Belbo 2010). The competitiveness of the
harwarder is based on the large proportion of the cutting work in relation to forwarding and to the
low relocation costs when compared to operating with the conventional harvesting system using
two machines (Kärhä 2006; Laitila 2008; Kärhä et al. 2018). Roadside brushwood stands are easily
accessible from existing road networks, but they can be scattered in the landscape and their size
may be too small to be economically viable for the two-machine system (harvester and forwarder)
which favours the dual purpose machine system.

1.2 Aim of the study

Productivity studies and information from the brushwood clearing and harvesting operations on
forest roadside sites are limited (Iwarsson-Wide 2009b,c). In order to have a better understanding
of the cost efficiency and profitability of alternative management practices and their operations,
more information on productivity is required as conditions can vary greatly from site to site. In
the present study, the productivity of brushwood clearing and harvesting on forest roadside sites
was defined by creating time-consumption models and parameters for the aforementioned work-
ing methods. In addition, tree species specific regression models for height and diameter at breast
height (DBH) 1.3 m were derived in which the stump diameter was the independent variable.
       The harvesting of brushwood was based on the harwarder in our study and the clearing of
brushwood was done with a spiral cutter, which is a novel accessory for cutting roadside vegetation.
The functionality of the spiral cutter is based on the rotating spiral, which pulls the material being
cut against the sharp blade and cuts it. Compared to traditional chain or reel mulchers the cutting
is more energy efficient and it does not toss wood splitters into the surroundings. Compiled time
consumption models and parameters for the brushwood clearing and harvesting can be used for
evaluating alternative management practices and to determine when brushwood biomass should
be harvested and when it should be left to decay.


2 Material and methods

2.1 Machinery studied

2.1.1 Harwarder

The base machine of the harwarder was a 8-wheeled Ponsse Buffalo Dual manufactured in 2018,
with an engine power of 205 kW, mass of 24 800 kg (equipped with 900 mm wide KOPA flotation
tracks) and load capacity of 14 000 kg (Fig. 1). The length of the load space was 4650 mm and
its cross-sectional area 5 m2. The loader model was K90DUAL+ with a 9-metre reach and 160
kilonewton meters (kNm) lifting moment. The loader was equipped with an Epec LoadOptimizer
crane scale with an accuracy of 2 kg. The harwarder-operator was skilful, and he had 30 years of

work experience in driving harvesters and 15 years of work experience in energy wood harvesting
with a harwarder.
       The harwarder head was a Moipu 300 F1 equipped with hydraulic shears, feed rollers and
delimbing knives (Fig. 1). The maximum cutting diameter with one cut was 30 cm. Multi-tree
handling was based on a system that enables the synchronising of the feed roller and delimbing
knife functions to operate as an accumulating device. The opening diameter of the delimbing knives
was 130 cm, which helps collecting and loading trees with the harwarder head. The height of the
harwarder head is 100 cm and it weighs 650 kg (www.moipu.com).

2.1.2 Spiral cutter

The base machine for the JAK SP-180 spiral cutter was a wheeled Neuson 6503 WD mini-excavator
manufactured in 2008, with an engine power of 43 kW and mass of 5935 kg. The JAK SP-180
spiral cutter was attached to the tip of the excavator boom (Fig. 2). The device was hydraulically
powered, and the flow rate of the excavator’s hydraulic system was 186 litres per minute. The
weight and operating width of the JAK SP-180 spiral cutter was 295 kg and 180 cm, respectively.
The manufacturer’s recommended maximum cutting diameter was 50–70 mm for the JAK SP-180
spiral cutter.

       The JAK SP-180 spiral cutter was made up of three rotating spirals with fixed underlying
plate-shaped blades (Fig. 2). Rotating spiral pulls the material being cut until the sharp-edged
blade cuts it off and brushwood falls backwards. The low rotation speed of the spirals (370 round
per minutes) minimizes the risk of thrown wood splinters and other damage to the surroundings.
The JAK SP-180 spiral cutter was made of high-strength and wear-resistant steel which allows
the lightweight structure of the device, which means that smaller carrier vehicles (min 5000 kg)
can also be used. The excavator-operator had over two years working experience with the spiral
cutter, and in addition, he was also the inventor and developer of the JAK SP-180 spiral cutter.

2.2 Time study plots and brushwood measurements

Time studies were carried out on a private forest road where clearing of brushwood had been done
randomly, or then neglected totally. The forest road had been built in the late 1980s and was located
in Iisalmi in Eastern Finland (63°26´N, 26°59´E). The width of the forest roadway was 4.5 m and
the width of the road area (including side slopes and ditches) averaged 10.5 m. Alongside the
forest road, 80 time study plots for the harwarder and 13 time study plots for the spiral cutter were
established. When establishing the time study plots, the aim was that the number and volume of
trees varied between the plots. In addition, for the harwarder harvesting, road sections where the
size of brushwood was bigger compared to those cleared with the spiral cutter were selected. The
length of the rectangular time study plots were 25 m and the widths equalled the measured work
path. The width of the time study plot was, on average 3.0 m for the harwarder and 1.8 m for the
spiral cutter. The boundaries of the time study plots alongside the forest road were marked by
means of marking paints and ribbons.
       The initial data from the time study plots were based on stump diameter measurements by
tree species which were carried out after harvesting and clearing. The stump diameter was measured
at 10 cm height from the ground to an accuracy of 1 mm while the tree species was determined
visually. All stump diameters by tree species were measured from the spiral cutter time study
plots and coverage of the measurement was thus 100%. For the harwarder time study plots, two
rectangular (5 m long and 3 m wide) sample plots were established that were located five m from
the beginning and end of the time study plot. The coverage of the sample plot measurements was
40% of the total time study plot area of the harwarder.
       The stump diameter data by tree species was complemented with sample tree data which
consisted measured information about the tree height, DBH and diameter at the stump height (10 cm
from the ground). The accuracy of the tree height measurements were 10 cm and the diameters
were measured to an accuracy of 1 mm. The randomly selected sample trees were measured while
establishing time study plots for the harwarder and the spiral cutter before beginning of the time
studies. The number of sample trees were 202 for all the time study plots. Based on the sample
tree measurement data, tree specific regression models for height and DBH were derived in which
the tree species specific stump diameter was the independent variable. The regression models were
used to describe the brushwood properties of the time study plot before harvesting or clearing. The
height of the measured sample trees varied in the range of 1.7–15.4 m and the DBH varied in the
range of 12–163 mm. The average height and DBH of the sample trees were 6.3 m with a standard
deviation (SD) of 2.5 m and 72 mm (SD 32). The stump diameter of the sample trees varied in
the range of 21–225 mm and the average stump diameter of the sample trees was 87 mm (SD 36).
       The measured sample tree data were combined as a data matrix and based on that were
derived tree specific regression models for height and DBH in which the tree species specific
stump diameter was the independent variable. The derived regression models, together with Repola
(2006, 2008, 2009) and Repola et al. (2007) biomass models in which the independent variables

were height and DBH, were used to describe the brushwood properties and dimensions on the time
study plots before harvesting and clearing.
       DBH and the tree height were strongly dependent on stump diameter. The tree species
specific regression models for height and DBH as well as statistical characteristics of regression
models are detailed in Table 1.

2.3 Time study

2.3.1 Time study of the harwarder

The harwarder time study was conducted between 3 and 5 June 2019 and the brushwood were
harvested as not delimbed. The brushwood harvested from the 80 harwarder time study plots was
weighted by the crane scale of the Ponsse Buffalo Dual harwarder during unloading and the above-
mentioned regression models for height and DBH were needed to estimate brushwood properties
(tree species specific biomass of stem wood, stem bark, foliage as well as living branches) and
relative proportions of tree species biomass for each harwarder time study plot before harvesting.
The weighted biomass was converted to m3 (solid) based on the relative proportions of tree spe-
cies on the time study plot. The number of harwarder loads weighed was the same as the number
of time study plots.
        The estimated share of tree species from the total cutting removal was 27% for Scots pine
(Pinus sylvestris L.), 33% for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), 20% for Downy birch
(Betula pubescens Ehrh.) and 19% for other broadleaved tree species such aspen, alder, rowan
and willow. The distribution of tree species biomass on the time study plot was calculated based
on Repola (2006, 2008, 2009) and Repola et al. (2007) biomass models in which the independ-
ent variables were height and DBH. The weighted cutting removal from time study plots were
converted to m3 with the tree species distribution specific green density (kg m–3) values produced

by Finnish Forest Research Institute (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 2010; Lindblad et al.
2010). The average green density was 912 kg m–3 (SD 15) on the time study plots.
       The respective values for the total number of trees harvested and volume were 5257 and
85.5 m3 during the time study. The average volume of the harvested trees varied in the range of
8–111 dm3, the harvesting intensity was 0.08–1.36 harvested trees per m2 (800–13 600 trees per
hectare, ha) and the harvesting removal was 0.23–1.87 m3 on the time study plots (30–249 m3
per ha). The volume of trees harvested (dm3) on a time study plot was calculated by dividing
the cutting removal (m3) by the number of trees harvested. The number of trees harvested was
obtained from the time study in which the number of trees in each grapple bunch during cutting
was observed and recorded (Table 2). The average stump diameter was 54 mm and it varied in
the range of 32–177 mm on the time study plots. Based on the stump diameter measurements,
the estimated average height of trees per time study plot was in the range of 2.7–11.7 m and the
average height of trees was 4.2 m (SD 1.3).
       Due to the time study’s plot-wise mass measurement method and study layout, the harwarder
loads were not completely full. The operational payload data was studied at the same site by a
follow-up study which determined the size of a full payload (7 loads and 45 861 kg total) as well as
grapple load size during unloading (173 grapple loads total). The follow-up study data was recorded
by the harwarder operator and Epec LoadOptimizer crane scale system. The driving distance with
load from the time study plot to the roadside landing and back as empty were measured by digital
map (www.karttapaikka.fi) to an estimated accuracy of 1 m.
       The time study was carried out manually with a Rufco-900 handheld field computer. The
time-study observer was placed in the cabin of the harwarder in a position that enabled him to
fully observe the harvesting operations and markings with minimal obstruction for the harwarder
operator. The working time was recorded through the application of a continuous timing method

locations                        harwarder stops moving to perform another activity at the working location, e.g.
                                 positioning to cut.
Positioning to cut               Begins when the boom starts to swing towards the first tree and ends when the empty
                                 harwarder head is resting on the tree before the felling cut at stump height begins.
                                 With tall trees (higher than 8 m), the harwarder head is first placed halfway along the
                                 tree to be felled.
Accumulating the felling         Begins when the felling cut starts (either at the stump height or halfway of the tree)

                                 harwarder. With tall trees the top is cut first, after which the harwarder head is moved
                                 vertically downward and the tree is cut again at the stump height. The number of
                                 trees in each harwarder head bunch is observed and recorded.

                                 harwarder starts to move to the next working location.

                                 when the harwarder stops to begin unloading at the landing area.
                                 Driving unloaded begins when the load is empty, the harwarder head is positioned

wherein a clock ran continuously and the times for different phases were separated from each
other under distinct numeric codes (Harstela 1991; Magagnotti et al. 2013). During the recording,
the cutting functions had the highest priority, followed by the loading, moving, unloading and the
arrangement elements. The time for the highest prioritized work element was recorded if multiple
work elements were performed simultaneously. Auxiliary time use (e.g. planning of work and
preparations) was included in the work phases in which it was observed. Productive machine (PM)
time, the working time excluding all delays (IUFRO 1995), was divided into the following work
phases as listed in Table 2.

2.3.2 Time study of the spiral cutter

The time study of the spiral cutter was conducted on 13 September 2019. The clearing work was
recorded using a video camera (GoPro 6), and the time study was carried out by one researcher who
analysed the collected video material. The camera was placed in the cabin of the mini-excavator in
a position that enabled it to fully record the clearing operation and the boundary markings of the
time study plots with minimal obstruction to the harvester operator. The video material was ana-
lysed by continuous timing from a computer screen using the Rufco-900 handheld field computer,
and the work elements and time study plots were separated from each other with numerical codes.
The work processes were recorded and the productive machine (PM) time on the time study plots
divided into work elements according to Table 3.
       The average stump diameter was 37 mm and it varied in the range of 27–54 mm on the time
study plots. Correspondingly, the maximum stump diameter was in the range of 34–99 mm on the
time study plots. The density of brushwood was 1.8–8.3 stumps per m2 (18 222–83 333 stumps
per ha) and the total cross-sectional area of stump diameters were in the range of 5.0–24.5 cm2
per m2 on the time study plots (5.0–24.5 m2 per ha). Based on the stump diameter measurements, the
estimated average height of brushwood trees per the time study plot was in the range of 1.9–4.0 m
and the average estimated height of trees was 2.9 m (SD 0.7).

2.4 Data analysis

In the modelling of the harwarder work, the recorded plot-wise time study data and the measured
harvested brushwood volumes were combined as a data matrix. The time consumption of the five
main work elements in the harwarder harvesting (Moving, Cutting, Loading, Unloading and For-
warding) were formulated through the application of regression analysis in which the harvesting
conditions, such as volume of harvested trees (dm3), the harvesting intensity (harvested trees per
ha), grapple load volume during loading and unloading (m3) and forwarding distance (m) were
independent variables. The unit for calculation of productive machine time consumption was
seconds per tree, per grapple load volume or per harwarder load, and productivity in harwarder
harvesting was expressed in solid cubic metres per productive machine hour time (m3 per PMh).

Continuous clearing of brushwood The mini-excavator is driving forward at a steady pace, brushwood is fed con-
                                 tinuously to the blades by rotating spirals, brushwood is cut down in a desirable
                                 direction (backwards) and the work is not interrupted
Slow down clearing of brushwood The mini-excavator has to slow down the driving speed or stop because brush-
                                 wood is cut down slowly, improperly or fell in an undesirable direction (towards
                                 mini-excavator). The clearing work is partly interrupted, but the spirals continue
                                 to rotate either forward or backwards

       Statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 statistical software. Dif-
ferent transformations and curve types were tested in order to achieve symmetrical residuals for
the derived regression models and in order to ensure the statistical significance of the coefficients.
The results of the regression model analyses are detailed in Table 4.
       The plot-wise productivity of the spiral cutter in brushwood clearing (PMh) were defined as
a function of the cleared area (ha per PMh) or as a function clearing speed (m per s). Both the con-
tinuous and slowed down clearing of brushwood were included in the plot-wise time consumption
and productivity analysis. Based on the stump diameter measurements, plot-wise productivity was
calculated as a function of maximum and average stump diameter, stump density, cross-sectional
area of stump diameters and estimated height of brushwood.


3 Results

3.1 Time consumption of working elements in harwarder harvesting

In this time study, moving between working locations represented 9% of the productive machine
time (Fig. 3). Positioning to cut and accumulating felling constituted 14% and 45% of the produc-
tive machine time in the harvesting of brushwood. Loading and unloading represented 19% and
13% of the productive machine time, respectively. Cross-cutting of standing trees at elevations
higher than stump height took 2% of the productive machine time and sorting of trees placed in
the load space of the harwarder 1%. Time consumption of driving loaded or unloaded are purely
dependent on forwarding distances and because the harwarder loads were not completely full, due
to the plot-wise mass measurement method, Fig. 3 focused on analysing the proportion of working
elements, which are done with the loader and harwarder head.

3.2 Time consumption models for harwarder harvesting

Moving time (TMoving) was dependent on the number of harvested trees per m2. The moving time
per tree harvested decreased as the number of trees harvested per ha; in such cases, it was pos-
sible to cut more trees from a single work location (Fig. 4). The time consumption of moving was
formulated as:

       Time consumption of multi-tree cutting (TCutting), expressed in seconds per harvested brush-
wood tree, was modelled from the average volume of harvested tree of each study plot. The time
consumptions of multi-tree cutting increased when larger-sized trees were harvested. The working
elements of positioning to cut, accumulating felling and cross-cutting of standing trees at eleva-
tions higher than stump height were included in the time model of multi-tree cutting. The time
consumption of multi-tree cutting was formulated as:

where
TCutting = time consumption of multi-tree cutting, expressed in seconds per harvested tree

      Loading time (TLoading), expressed in seconds per m3, was dependent on the grapple load size
during the loading cycle (Fig. 5). The grapple load size (x3) was dependent on the average volume
of harvested brushwood trees (Eq. 2) and number of trees in the grapple during loading (Eq. 4).

       When modelling the time consumption for unloading (TUnloading) expressed in seconds per m3,
the average grapple load size during unloading was the independent variable. In the time studies,
the average grapple load size for unloading was 0.26 m3 (min 0.18 m3 – max 0.39 m3) and 0.29 m3
in the follow up study. A total of 5.4 seconds per m3 auxiliary time was added to the unloading
time, which was used, e.g. for sorting trees placed in the load space of the harwarder before the
final grip for unloading. Time consumption of unloading was formulated as:

x4 = grapple load size during unloading, m3
5.4 = Sorting of trees placed in the load space of the harwarder. Average handling time, seconds

       The forwarding distance (Fig. 6) was the independent variable for time consumption of for-
warding (TForwarding) using the harwarder on the forest road. The forwarding distance was defined
as a mean of driving loaded and driving unloaded distances (Manner et al. 2016). The time con-
sumption of forwarding, expressed in seconds per load, were the same both for driving as loaded
and unloaded. Load size was excluded from the model as a second independent variable, since
the loads were not full during the time study due to the time study’s plot-wise mass measurement
method and study layout. The average payload was 1.07 m3 (SD 0.31) and it varied in the range of
0.23–1.87 m3 during the time study. It is quite obvious that such a small payload does not overload
the forwarder’s engines or transmission systems design power, or the frame volume of the whole
tree load does not complicate the harwarder’s normal stability. Time consumption of transporting
was formulated as:

       Based on the follow up study, the average payload of full loads was 7.1 m3. The harvest-
ing productivity per productive machine hour time (m3 PMh–1) was calculated by dividing 3600
seconds by the total harvesting time consumption (TTotal).
       Harvesting productivity was more sensitive to the average volume of harvested brushwood
trees than to the forwarding distance (Fig. 7). While the average volume of brushwood trees was
doubled from 15 to 30 dm³, harvesting productivity was increased 20% from 6.5 to 8.4 m3 PMh–1
with the forwarding distance of 100 m. Respective productivities were 5.9 and 7.4 m3 PMh–1
with the forwarding distance of 400 m. Alternatively, when analysing clearing productivity as in
ha PMh–1, the effect of the average brushwood tree volume was opposite compared to harvesting
productivity, the bigger was the average brushwood tree volume the lower was the clearing pro-
ductivity (Fig. 8). To bear in mind, both results were calculated with the payload of 7.1 m³, and
with 6000 trees harvested per hectare.

3.4 Efficiency of the spiral cutter

The plot-wise productivity of the JAK SP-180 spiral cutter in brushwood clearing varied in the
range of 0.19–0.61 ha per PMh (Fig. 9). Correspondingly, the plot-wise speed of brushwood clearing
varied in the range of 0.29–0.95 m per second (Fig. 10). An increase in the average and maximum
stump diameter slow down both the clearing productivity and clearing speed of the JAK SP-180
spiral cutter (Figs. 9 and 10) and there was a clear step downward in clearing productivity as the
average diameter increased from 30 mm to 40 mm (Fig. 9). Thin brushwood is cut off in one spiral
rotation whereas thicker brushwood needs two rotations or more, which slow down clearing speed
and productivity (Figs. 9 and 10). The number of stumps per ha had no effect on the time study
plot-wise clearing productivity (Fig. 11).

           JAK SP-180 spiral cutter as a function of stump density per ha.



        The estimated height of brushwood is strongly dependent on measured stump diameters
on the time study plot. An increase in the height of brushwood increased the plot-wise time con-
sumption of working elements and slow down brushwood clearing (Fig. 12). It is obvious that
the clearing of robust brushwood takes more time and with high brushwood, the risk that it fell in
an undesirable direction and hit the base-machine is also bigger compared to shorter brushwood.
       The time-study plot number 7, having average stump diameter of 31 mm and density of
83 333 stumps per ha seems to be an outlier, when analysing factors affecting time consumption and
efficiency of brushwood clearing with the JAK SP-180 spiral cutter. Based on the stump diameter
or brushwood height only, the time consumption should be one of the lowest among the time study
plots included to the experiment. Instead, it was the highest in the experiment. Obviously, the high
time consumption can be explained with the extraordinary large cross-sectional area of stump
diameters on the time study plot number 7 (Fig. 13). The cross-sectional area of stump diameters
describes the combined effect of stump diameters and number of stumps on the time study plot.

4 Discussion and conclusions

In this study, time-consumption models for brushwood harvesting, defined productivity parameters
for brushwood clearing and derived tree specific regression models for brushwood height and
DBH were formulated. Results and formulas can be used in further studies as a basis for evaluat-
ing alternative management practices of brushwood cuttings next to forest roads and to determine,
when brushwood biomass should be recovered and when it should be left to decay. When applying
the results, it is important to remember that the width of the cleared side slope was 3.0 m for the
harwarder and 1.8 m for the spiral cutter. The spiral cutter must drive twice so that the width of
the cleared area is approximately the same as with the harwarder.
        The studied machinery worked well, there were no interruptions due to machine breakdowns
and the quality of the work was good (e.g. brushwood was cleared properly and contaminants e.g.
roots and soil in the harvested brushwood was excluded). However, when reviewing the results,
it has to be taken into account that the results are based on only one, relatively small-scale test,
which does not fully correspond to real world work. Therefore, they must not be used, e.g. as a
baseline for productivity in determination of unit costs for brushwood harvesting and clearing.
Accordingly, a long-term follow-up study would give a more reliable picture of productivity in
practice (Magagnotti et al. 2013), as well as of the functional and technical utilization rate of the
machinery in varying roadside brushwood conditions, at different times of the year.
        In the year 2008 and 2009, Skogforsk carried out two case studies about brushwood harvest-
ing along forest roadsides (Iwarsson-Wide 2009b,c). In the first study, a Valmet 911 equipped with
a Bracke C16 circular saw accumulating felling head was used, and felled brushwood was placed
in grapple piles at the roadside. In the second study, a Ponsse Dual harwarder with a multi-tree
handling, shear felling head (Ponsse EH25) was examined. Felled brushwood was loaded directly
and forwarded to storage. In the time study plots, which were 4.5 m wide, the number of stems
per hectare varied between 7000 and 4300, and the cutting removal between 39 and 52 tonnes dry
matter (oven-dry tonne of forest biomass) per hectare. The average heights of brushwood in the
two studies were 5.5 m and 9.2 m, respectively. The average productivity in felling and harvest-
ing were 2.6 and 3.7 tonnes dry matter per PMh, respectively, which are at the same level as our
results when the impact of forwarding is considered.

       There is a wide variety of studies available on forest road maintenance (Parr and Way 1988;
Coulter et al. 2006; Pellegrini et al. 2013; Kiss et al. 2015; Kaakkurivaara 2018; Laschi et al. 2019),
but surprisingly there are no studies regarding clearing productivity of brushwood along roadsides,
which has traditionally been regarded as a part of regular road maintenance. There exist many
studies developing biomass supply systems for forested marginal land (Iwarsson-Wide 2009a,b,c;
Di Fulvio et al. 2012; Fernandez-Lacruz et al. 2013; Jyhä et al. 2015; Jylhä and Bergström 2016;
Spinelli et al. 2017; Fernandez-Lacruz 2019), but the direct comparison of results is difficult because
circumstances, working methods or measurement units are different.
       The common practice in forest technology is to use volume or DBH to model biomass
removal and harvesting productivity, but, for example, in the study of Fernandez-Lacruz et al.
(2013), tree height was chosen as the independent variable when modelling harvesters’ productivity
(productive machine time consumption per oven-dry tonne of forest biomass) in the clearing of
power line corridors. Better comparability of results and description of circumstances, in addition to
plot-wise measurement accuracy, were the reasons why the tree species specific regression models
for height and DBH were included in our study and presented in the results.
       The density and dimensions of brushwood along the forest roadside varies greatly and the
problem is that biomass-rich forest road sections are embedded in the less biomass-rich sections.
In some sections of forest roadsides there is plenty of tall brushwood, while others virtually lack
brushwood suitable for harvesting, but are an excellent section for clearing. In order to guarantee
cost efficient use of existing machinery, accurate methods for assessing and mapping potential
sections for brushwood clearing and harvesting along forest roadsides are needed when renovating
and maintaining dilapidated forest roads. Lately, a novel laser scanning–based approach identi-
fying forest road sections that fulfil requirements for brushwood harvesting has been developed
(Iwarsson-Wide et al. 2013). The accuracy of the approach has been evaluated and result were
already correct in 64% of the cases.
       Based on the study results, the average volume of harvested brushwood and forwarding
distance are the key elements that have an effect on harvesting productivity with the harwarder
(Fig. 7). The same has been noted in previous studies early thinnings (Laitila and Asikainen 2006;
Kärhä 2006; Rottensteiner et a. 2008). Correspondingly, stump diameter has a strong impact on
the clearing productivity of brushwood with the spiral cutter (Fig. 9). In addition to the presented
productivity data, income from the harvested brushwood as well as hourly cost of the existing
machinery are the key-elements for the comprehensive cost study to determine in what kind of
cases roadside brushwood should be recovered and where it should be left to decay.
