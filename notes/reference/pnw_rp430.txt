           A study was conducted on the productivity and cost of an integrated harvesting and
           processing system operating in small-diameter timber (western hemlock-type) on the
           Olympic Peninsula of western Washington. The system uses a new steep-slope feller-
           buncher, a clam-bunk grapple-skidder (forwarder), a prototype chain-flail debarker-
           delimber, a chipper, a conveyor system, and a prototype shredder. The study showed
           that the system harvested and processed trees at a combined-system cost of $7.80
           per green ton at a production rate of 455 green tons per day. The delivered product
           mix was 53 percent chips, 21 percent saw logs, and 26 percent hogged fuel by
           weight. The productivity and machine rate of each piece of harvesting and process-
           ing equipment and other data are given.

Summary    An integrated harvesting and processing system is operating in dense stands of
           small-diameter timber (western hemlock-type) on the Olympic Peninsula of western
           Washington. The stands are being clearcut to a 1-inch by 10-foot standard with an
           integrated system employing six pieces of woodland equipment, three of which are
           distinctly new. Trees are felled and bundled with a new steep-slope feller-buncher
           and carried to an in-woods processing system by a clam-bunk grapple-skidder (for-
           warder) where they are sorted and simultaneously processed into three products:
           saw logs, clean-pulp chips, and hogged fuel. A prototype, multiple-stem, chain-flail
           debarker-delimber prepares some stems for chipping. Bark, branches, trim ends, and
           very small trees not processed into saw logs or clean chips are lifted by a conveyor-
           grapple system into a prototype shredder, which processes all remaining woody
           materials into hogged fuel.

           A study was conducted to quantify the operating parameters of the system, including
           production rates and costs of individual machines, the interdependency of equipment
           at the processing site, and the overall production cost of the system.

           The study showed that the system harvested and processed about 300 green tons of
           products per acre from 2,300 standing trees per acre at a production rate of 455 tons
           per day and at a cost of $7.80 per green ton. The delivered product mix was 53 per-
           cent chips, 21 percent saw logs, and 26 percent hogged fuel by weight. Because the
           processing system produced three distinct products simultaneously, costs of opera-
           tion could not be rigidly attributed to individual products. This integrated system was
           able to economically produce three separate products simultaneously from a stag-
           nated stand of small-diameter trees, where single-product extraction had not pre-
           viously been profitable.

Background   Natural regeneration after a series of catastrophic fires, the latest in the mid-1920s,
             produced overstocked stands of small trees on the Olympic Peninsula in the State of
             Washington. About 20,000 acres of these stands are on the Quilcene Ranger District,
             Olympic National Forest. These stands, with average diameters of 8 inches and less,
             have stocking densities up to 40,000 stems per acre. Doghair 1 is a local term that
             has been used to describe these stands. These stands (fig. 1) are comprised pri-
             marily of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), Douglas-fir (Pseudo-
             tsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesfi), and western redcedar (Thuja plicata
             Donn ex D. Don), and occasional large cedar snags.

             Because of the overstocked conditions, growth in the doghair stands is well below
             normal. A goal of land managers has been to restore these stands to a more pro-
             ductive state. Conventional harvesting methods and equipment have been poorly
             adapted to the dense, small-diameter trees, and have resulted in inefficient handling
             of small trees, high costs, and low product recovery per acre. Stand-conversion
             alternatives have also proved to be cost prohibitive. It seemed unconventional means
             would be required to accomplish the objective of converting these stands to more
             productive conditions.

             1 See glossary for terms used in this report.




             Figure 1--Dense stand of small-diameter trees in the
             study area near Quilcene, Washington. Harvesting stands
             such as this requires innovative technology and multiple-
             product marketing.
 Early attempts to rehabilitate these stands were complicated by inadequate equip-
ment for harvesting and processing, ineffective marketing for all potential products,
and adverse environmental impacts, particularly soil compaction. In recent years,
several timber operators have attempted to harvest doghair stands by using combi-
nations of equipment and marketing options. These approaches, however, also
proved to be unsuccessful because of inefficiencies in either harvesting, processing,
or marketing. One timber operator devised a central, in-woods processing operation
to take advantage of new technologies and whole-tree product marketing. In addition,
innovations in felling and skidding stems to the in-woods processing operation were
attempted and refined. The use of feller-bunchers and multiple-stem forwarding
proved to be the most efficient and cost-effective means for delivering the trees to
the processing center. A great deal of progress has been made in making better
equipment and methods for handling and processing doghair stands. Equally impor-
tant has been the successful marketing of all biomass components of these stands
as saw logs, clean chips, and hogged fuel.

In 1983, the USDA Forest Service awarded a contract to Hermann Brothers Logging
and Construction Company (1) to enable continued development and study of equip-
ment and methods for economically converting stagnated stands of small trees to a
productive status and (2) to provide the basis for a comprehensive study of the tech-
nology and economic feasibility of removing and using the products from small-
diameter tree stands. 2

In 1986, a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (Bonneville Power Administra-
tion) through the Pacific Northwest and Alaska Bioenergy Program was awarded to
Hermann Brothers to assist in the development of specialized equipment for produc-
ing biomass fuels from these overstocked stands.

In the past 4 years, the timber operator has developed and applied several arrange-
ments of equipment in search of better harvesting and processing economy and
efficiency. One specific need was a feller-buncher capable of operating on terrain
steeper than 30 percent, thus extending the area available for timber harvesting. A
new steep-ground feller-buncher was developed, with a self-leveling boom carriage
that automatically stabilizes the operator's control cab on slopes up to 70 percent.
Preliminary evaluations showed this machine to be faster and capable of operating
on much steeper ground (80 percent) than other felling and bunching machines in
use at the time. This feller-buncher, coupled with a clam-bunk skidder (grapple
forwarder), has greatly improved the efficiency and economics of delivering small-
diameter trees to the in-woods processing site. The timber operator has also used
mobile cable yarders to bring trees into the in-woods processing system, where
slopes have exceeded the slope capabilities of the clam-bunk skidder.

             This report describes the cost and productivity of equipment systems observed dur-
             ing two related studies. The first study focused on the successful felling, bunching,
             and forwarding operations being used in the doghair stands on the Quilcene District.
             The second study addressed the operation of an in-woods, whole-tree-utilization
             system that was observed in fall and winter of 1986-87. The intent of the studies was
             to capture the comprehensive technical and economic information provided by appli-
             cation of this new technology to small-diameter tree stands. These studies were con-
             ducted simultaneously to share common elements.

             This report provides information to evaluate a promising biomass-harvesting method
             and a basis for evaluating harvests of similar stands elsewhere in the region. As
             noted in a recent issue of Biologue, "The profitable conversion of small-diameter
             trees could result in significant increases in supplies of woody biomass for production
             of energy...a key element in the effective marketing of small-diameter trees" (Anon.
             1986). Energy values from whole-tree chips are high (Howard 1987), providing an
             incentive to use biomass that would othe,"wise be left as residue. The proven ability
             to efficiently harvest small-diameter stands and multiple-product marketing will pro-
             vide new opportunities to the land manager. Stands previously thought to be unmer-
             chantable may now be considered in a different way. Potential sites for applying this
             technology include stands currently defined as precommercial size, having underused
             species (such as Iodgepole pine and red alder), available for commercial thinning,
             and available for removal of smaller tree.', in a double-entry harvest system. Econom-
             ics, and other factors, may still limit some applications. The ability to use all possible
             products in a stand in a cost effective manner, however, will affect the management
             and harvest of the region's second-grow'h timber.

Objectives   The objective of this effort was to characterize and quantify the operating parameters
             of the existing harvesting and processing system being used for stands of small-
             diameter trees. The effort is being made because of the need for a cost-effective
             stand conversion method. Potential multiple-product markets for the biomass har-
             vested from these stands present an opi~'ortunity for increased revenue to aid the
             conversion of these stands.

             Specific objectives of these studies were as follows:

             1. Determine the quantities and types of wood products harvested and processed per
             acre from the doghair study area by the system.

             2. Determine the costs and production rate of each piece of equipment used in the
             harvesting and processing subsystems.

             3. Identify and sum the total costs ($) of owning and operating the harvesting and
             processing subsystems during the study periods.

             4. Determine the total productive cost (S/ton) of harvesting and processing with this
             system as it produces the observed product mix.

Processing System   Several field trials of various combinations of equipment and material handling
                    processes were tried with limited successes. Figure 5 shows an overview of the final
                    central processing system being used on study site B. The system is arranged so
                    that the trees to be processed arrive on one end, and the products are hauled away
                    in trucks from the opposite end. The processing system consisted of the following
                    specific equipment:

                 processing site and the road that leads to it. Items in this category included earth-
                 moving trucks, front end loaders, bull dozers, and motor graders. In the current oper-
                 ating system, approved by the Quilcene District, a large (D-6 size) tractor is used
                 after harvest for ripping the soil on heavily traveled paths, such as the "go back" road
                 used by the forwarder.

                 Maintenance equipment--Service vehicles with welders, hoists, and spare parts
                 used to maintain the processing equipment in operating condition. Fuel and oil
                 vehicles were also used.

                 Crew transportation--A six-passenger pickup truck used to transport the work crew
                 to the work site each day.

Study Methods    Two study blocks were selected for whole-tree harvesting during this study. Cost and
                 productivity information was recorded while the prototype harvesting and processing
                 system operated normally in the study area. Trees to be harvested were preinven-
                 toried by using conventional stand exams. Processed products were weighed as they
                 were taken out of the area. This put production data on a green-weight-per-unit-time
                 basis. Cost information was on a dollar-per-productive-hour basis. This resulted in
                 productive costs being expressed in dollars per green ton.

                 A steady-state operation was observed, free of any transitory effects of equipment
                 set-up or move-out. Each study block was completely harvested during the respec-
                 tive harvest period. Study of processing was done concurrently with the study of har-
                 vesting so the same stand could be observed from the start of felling to the end of
                 processing. Simultaneous studies simplified the field work because stand exams and
                 truck weighing applied to both studies. Furthermore, all nonstudy materials were
                 removed from the processing site before each study period so that only trees from
                 the marked study blocks were processed.

Area Selection   The study area, on the Quilcene Ranger District, Olympic National Forest, consisted
                 of 3.12 acres (block A) plus 3.48 acres (block B) of small-diameter trees within a tim-
                 ber sale (Doghair Unit 79) that was under contract for harvest and site conversion
                 during the study. Both study blocks had similar stand density and terrain. Slopes
                 ranged from 20 to 35 percent. Each block was selected so as to allow a single for-
                 warder to keep the processing equipment busy. An additional forwarder was some-
                 times used by the operator to cover longer distances, however. The blocks were
                 laid out in roughly rectangular shapes for convenience in marking and harvesting.
                 Figure 11 shows the location of the study area.

                      The soils underlying these overstocked stands are Entisols and Inceptisols that devel-
                      oped on deposits from continental glaciers (Jennings and others 1982). Generally,
                      these geologic materials differ in particle size and shape, strata orientation, degree of
                      compaction, and resistance to weathering. The soils are weakly developed, lacking
                      structure and differentiation of horizons; this has resulted in soils that are highly vari-
                      able even within small areas of similar relief. Many of the unstructured subsurface
                      layers are impermeable and seem deficient in nitrogen (N) and some micronutrients
                      such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) with perhaps toxic levels of manganese (Mn)
                      (Little and Waddel11987).

Stand Inventory       The number and size of trees in each study block were determined by a routine
                      stand-exam procedure. On each block, twelve one-fiffieth-acre circular plots were
                      systematically laid out. All standing trees in the plots, living and dead, were inven-
                      toried by 1-inch diameter classes and species. Diameters at breast height of all
                      sample trees were recorded, and heights of three randomly selected trees in each
                      diameter class were recorded. The ground slope was measured, and terrain rough-
                      ness was assessed. An estimate of the total number of trees by diameter class for
                      each block was computed from these data.

Time and Production   Observations were recorded during harvesting and processing to provide data from
Measurements          which estimates of production rates for each piece of equipment in the system could
                      be made; this required observations of the operation of each piece of equipment.
                      Operational-time components were recorded for all equipment throughout the study.
                      In addition, more detailed observations that included production information such as
                      number of pieces handled were made on each machine during several randomly
                      chosen, intense, hourly sample periods. Table 1 shows the intense observation time
                      for each machine on each study block as a percentage of the total operating time.
                      Time elements and units of production were recorded as described below.

     Time measurements--For each piece of equipment, an on-site observer recorded
     time in the following categories:

     Time category              Definitions

     Scheduled time             Total planned work hours that each piece of equipment
                                was assigned to the job. Also, the sum of all time
                                components: that is productive, idle, delay, and down
                                times (total operational time).

     Productive time            Hours when equipment was working at the assigned
                                task(s).

     Idle time                  Time when equipment was ready to be productive but
                                could not process material because none was available
                                from the previous process (no workload).

     Delay time                 Time when equipment could not complete material
                                processing because the subsequent process was fully
                                loaded and could not accept new material (bottleneck
                                ahead).

     Down time                  Time when equipment was unavailable for productive
                                work because of scheduled or nonscheduled interrup-
                                tion of processing due to mechanical or operator
                                inability to proceed.

Figure 12--Total green weight of all products was found by
weighing all trucks on portable scales.


Production measurements--Production of the harvesting and processing system
was measured in units of green weight (tons). Weight units are preferred to other
units such as cords, board feet, or even cubic feet for biomass measurements be-
cause all forms and parts of the tree can be consistently accounted for by weight.
Very small trees cannot be measured by existing board-foot rules, and no other
measurement adequately tracks limbs and tops. Also, many wood-handling systems
are limited in how much weight they can lift, and equipment designers and operators
can be more effective when they know how much actual weight is to be handled.
Weight units can readily be converted to other units of measure when needed to aid
communication. If desired, green weight may be adjusted for moisture content to
reflect wood weight at a different moisture content, such as bone-dry units.

For this study, all products being taken from the processing site at the landing were
weighed on portable truck scales (fig. 12). Each truck was weighed, both loaded and
unloaded, so that the product net weight could be determined. The portable-scale
results were corroborated with mill scales where the products were delivered. The
net weights of each product were summed to give the individual production of logs,
chips, and hogged fuel. The weights of all products were then summed to give the
aggregated production (multiple-product yield) from the study blocks. Because the
landing was cleared before and after each study period, the assumption was made
that the total product weight 4 was equivalent to the weight of all trees handled by the
feller-buncher and subsequently by the forwarder and also the mobile loader. Simi-
larly, the weight of all chips was the production of the chipper and the debarker-
delimber. The total hogged-fuel weight was the production of the shredder, and the
production of saw logs was equal to the weight of the logs that were hauled out on
log trucks.

4 Moisture loss was assumed to be negligible during the har-
vesting and processing activities. Moisture is lost, however,
because trees continue to transpire moisture when felled and
left on the ground with their crowns intact. Moisture also
evaporates during the chipping and shredding operations (as
witnessed in visible evaporation from warm chips in freshly
loaded vans). The extent of moisture loss from these sources
is unknown.

 Cost and Machine Rate   The cost of harvesting and processing these small-diameter trees was an important
 Determinations          part of the study because the economics of stand conversion by using the central
                         processing system and multiple-product marketing affects how and where the system
                         may be applied.

                         A machine rate was calculated for each piece of equipment. The machine rate is
                         defined as the hourly cost of ownership and operation for a machine or process,
                         including investment amortization, consumables, and labor costs. The machine rate
                         is based on a productive hour. This takes machine reliability (availability) and usage
                         rate (ratio of productive time to scheduled time) into account. Costs of ownership
                         (Mifflin 1980) were calculated for each piece of equipment, based on factors such as
                         original investment, interest rates, salvage value, depreciation period, taxes, and
                         insurance. Similarly, operating costs, including fuel and oil consumed plus labor and
                         supervision expenses, were also calculated for each piece of equipment.

                         Productive costs of each machine were calculated by dividing machine rates by the
                         corresponding production rates. Total productive costs of owning and operating the
                         harvesting system were calculated by summing the productive costs of the two
                         machines of that system. For the harvesting system, however, the productive costs of
                         the individual machines are not additive because each machine processes a different
                         percentage of woody materials; therefore, the productive cost of the processing sys-
                         tem was calculated by summing the products of the productive cost of each machine
                         and the quantity of materials handled by that machine, and then dividing that sum by
                         the total weight of all woody products delivered. This is equivalent to dividing the total
                         cost of all operations by the total weight of all products from the system.

                         The following computation methods and equations were used to calculate the values
                         needed to satisfy the objectives of this study:

                         Production rates for each harvesting and processing operation were calculated by
                         dividing the total production of each operation by the total productive time spent to do
                         that operation during the study.

                         Machine rates for each piece of equipment were calculated with the equations below.

                         The productive-time ratio of each machine was calculated by dividing the produc-
                         tive time of each machine by the scheduled time for that machine.

                         Machine availability was calculated from the equation below to quantify the reliabil-
                         ity of the equipment during this study.

                         The productive cost for the total harvesting and processing system was calculated
                         by dividing the total cost of all operations by the total weight of all products loaded
                         onto trucks or vans for delivery to market.

                                                                                                            15
                  A prototype debarker-delimber for multiple stems (designed and built by Hermann
                  Bros.) was used during the study. This machine uses chain-flails to remove bark and
                  limbs. Chains were mounted on twin vertical shafts. The debarker-delimber had no
                  built-in feed system. Feeding was accomplished by the mobile loader in conjunction
                  with the grapple of the chipper. The mobile loader passed trees through the chain-
                  flails until they exited the debarker-delimber within reach of the chippers grapple,
                  which grasped the cleaned stems and fed them directly into the chippers feedworks.

                  The biomass shredder was also designed and fabricated by Hermann Brothers. It
                  was put into service on the study area about 3 months before the study.

                  The magnet and its collecting bin were built and added to the processing system at
                  the beginning of the processing study on block A. The debris conveyor system was
                  introduced to the processing system a few days before the beginning of the study on
                  block B. This support equipment was also designed and fabricated by the Hermann
                  Brothers from commercially available components. The processing system was
                  moved onto the prepared landing and was ready for production in about 2 hours.
                  Each landing was about one third of an acre and was adjacent to a lower corner of a
                  study block. Materials from about 40 acres of doghair stands were handled on each
                  landing.

Stand Inventory   Table 2 lists the population of trees on each study block by diameter class. About
                  half of the trees on each block were dead. The living trees were comprised of west-
                  ern hemlock (33 percent), Douglas-fir (28 percent), redcedar (22 percent), true fir
                  (16 percent), and alder (1 percent). About 78 percent of the trees on block A and
                  85 percent of the trees on block B had diameters of 6 inches or less. The stand
                  inventory showed that block A contained 1,642 stems per acre and block B contained
                  2,283 trees per acre. A statistical analysis showed the standard error of the mean to
                  be 151.8 trees per acre (9.3 percent) on bl~ck A and 200.7 trees per acre (8.8 per-
                  cent) on block B. The mean stand diameter for all trees on both blocks was 4.1
                  inches. The canopy was closed with a typical live tree height of about 95 feet. This
                  stand characterization is given to help compare doghair stands to stands in other
                  areas.

                  During the study, most of the smaller, dead trees were not delivered to the process-
                  ing site. Because of the extent of decay, they usually broke into short pieces during
                  the felling process. Adjusting the stand exam for this situation by excluding dead
                  trees under 4 inches, the estimated number of trees processed from block A was
                  896 per acre and 1,241 trees per acre from block B.

Products          All trees taken from the study blocks were transported to the sorting and processing
                  site at the landing. Materials were not allowed to accumulate at the landing. Depend-
                  ing on their size and quality, the trees wer~ processed into three different products:
                  saw logs, pulp quality chips, or hogged fuel (table 3).

Production Rates   The overall-system-daily production rates are shown in table 4. These average rates
                   are based on 10-hour workdays and net product weights of 25 tons per log truck and
                   20 tons per chip or hogged-fuel truck.

                   Table 5 summarizes the production rates of the harvesting and processing equipment
                   on each study block. Note that the production rates refer to the individual pieces of
                   equipment and not to the products or to the material-handling processes. The produc-
                   tion rates of all equipment were higher on block B than on block A. Progress on a
                   learning curve may have had a slight effect, and there were more trees and slightly
                   larger trees on block B, but the main contributor to higher production rates was the
                   addition of a conveyor system to the processing system at the landing. As materials
                   flowed through the landing faster, the forwarder was able to deliver trees faster, there-
                   by making more efficient use of its productive time. The time spent by the forwarder
                   in roadway improvements also contributed to a higher production rate on block B.

Harvesting--The FB-1 (ATH-28) steep-slope feller-buncher was used to mechan-
ically fell and simultaneously bunch the trees On both study blocks. Block A was
felled in November 1986; block B was fe'led in January 1987. Forwarding was done
entirely with a single forwarder (clam-bunk skidder, Timberjack 520A). Forwarding
was done simultaneously with the processing operation, about 1 week after felling
each block.

Cutting--Felling and bunching with the steep-slope feller-buncher progressed effi-
ciently and effectively with the machine working both uphill and downhill. Butts of the
trees were placed downhill for easy loading by the clam-bunk skidder. Because less
rotation of the felling boom was required when working uphill, the production rate of
the feller-buncher was about 40 percent higher on the uphill passes. The independ-
ently pivoting, quad-track drive system of the feller-buncher gave it excellent mobil-
ity over uneven terrain on all slopes encountered, which ranged between 20-35 per-
cent in the stand and up to 60 percent in short stretches. The automatic leveling
feature of the feller-buncher boom platform functioned well, keeping the operator
from working in unnatural positions and allowing him and the machine to operate
consistently and smoothly. The machine had high ground clearance (almost 3 feet),
which enabled it to pass easily over many ground obstacles that would have im-
peded travel of most woods machinery. The effective reach of the cutting head was
about 60 feet from one side to the other, compared to a cutting path of about 40 feet
by the conventional feller-bunchers used in the area.




                                                                                      19
     The production rates of the feller-buncher on this test were 55 and 60 tons per pro-
     ductive hour, respectively, on blocks A and B. Based on data collected during the in-
     tense, hourly sample periods, the corresponding production rates in number of stems
     per productive hour were 195 and 225. The overall production rate on an area basis
     was 0.20 acres per productive hour on both blocks A and B. The feller-buncher aver-
     aged 2.27 stems per cycle on block A and 2.24 stems per cycle on block B. A limited
     observation (1 hour only) of relative production rates of uphill vs. downhill operation
     during the study on block B showed that the feller-buncher cut and bunched 124
     cycles per productive hour during uphill operation and 87 cycles per productive hour
     during downhill operation. A cycle is defined here to be the felling, rotating, and
     bunching movements of the machine. A cycle was counted each time the trees held
     in the shear head were released onto the ground or a bunch. Table 6 shows the dis-
     tribution of piece count handled by the feller-buncher on each cycle. Over 40 percent
     of the cycles handled only one tree, and 80 percent of the cycles handled three or
     fewer trees.

     The number of stems harvested, based on the observed production rate, was 9 per-
     cent higher than the number of trees based on the adjusted stand exam on block A
     and 13 percent lower on block B.

     Table 7 summarizes the operational-time components of the feller-buncher on each
     study block. The 8-percent downtime on block A consisted of 34 minutes to replace a
     broken hydraulic hose on the felling head, 17 minutes total for checking and bleeding
     lines, and 34 minutes for operator breaks.

from the felling and bunching sites of each study block to the roadside landing,
where they were processed for transportation to market. Block A was forwarded in
November 1986; block B was forwarded in January 1987. A typical turn of about
50-70 trees arrived about every 18 minutes on either block. The forwarder usually
climbed to the top of the block and then loaded trees from the prearranged bunches
as it headed back downhill towards the landing. The operator swiveled his seat
around backwards to drive the machine in reverse or to operate the loading grapple.
Traveling toward the landing, the operator faced forward, stopping occasionally to
add logs to the bunk as the load straightened and settled during travel. Periodically,
the operator would close the clam jaws to compact the load. The clam-bunk jaws
would be closed when the load was complete, and the operator would continue to
drive downhill toward the landing. This driving would straighten and further compact
the load as the trees were pulled into the roadway, behind the forwarder, often
making room for even more trees to be loaded onto the bunk. After the bunk was
full, the operator would typically hold one or more larger trees in the loading-grapple
jaws as he continued toward the landing. Once at the landing, both grapple and bunk
jaws were opened, and the forwarder would drive ahead, allowing the trees to fall
onto the ground within reach of the mobile loader. The forwarder seemed to perform
its work smoothly and efficiently. It accomplished the forwarding operation on both
study blocks without difficulty. The machine seemed to have adequate power and
traction to climb the slopes on the study blocks. It also had sufficient power to lift the
butt end of any tree and sometimes as many as 10 trees as it positioned them onto
its bunk. It had sufficient agility and maneuverability to access the prebunched trees,
while negotiating over and around many large culls and stumps. Forwarding with a
clam-bunk skidder seems to be limited by uphill gradeability to slopes under 50 per-
cent. Cable yarders (also used by Hermann Brothers in doghair stands) could reach
trees bunched by the steep-slope feller-buncher on slopes greater than 50 percent.

The forwarder was also observed in use as a road-building device. On major skid
roads that required multiple passes by the forwarder, the forwarder was used to lay
small limbs and tree tops into surface depressions to minimize mud holes and soil
compaction.




                                                                                        21
     Observed production rates of the forwarder on this test were 46 and 65 tons per pro-
     ductive hour, respectively, on blocks A and B. Corresponding production rates in units
     of stems per productive hour were 161 and 244, based on earlier stem counts going
     into the prebunched piles. The production rate on an area basis was 0.17 acres per
     productive hour on blocks A and 0.22 acres per productive hour on block B. This
     production rate approximated the production rate of the feller-buncher, for the skid-
     ding distances of this study. The two machines worked well together in this respect.
     The feller-buncher operator always positioned the prebunched piles of trees with the
     maximum convenience of the forwarder operator in mind, that is, semi-herring bone
     fashion with the butts downhill. Harvesting sequence and travel routes were carefully
     planned by the operators and coordinated with the material flow needs of the process-
     ing system.

     While study observations were being made, the forwarder provided a continual flow
     of trees for the processing system at the landing. The operator used slack demand
     times for nonproductive activities such as road maintenance, hydraulic hose replace-
     ments, and lunch breaks. The forwarder operator was observed to pace arrival times
     at the landing according to the stockpile of unprocessed trees. This was done by
     varying the route and distance traveled to load trees. When the stockpile was high,
     the forwarder loaded trees from the far end of the study block, bypassing some
     closer trees, which could later be quickly forwarded on demand when the stockpile
     was low. The operator also regularly bypassed some larger trees that were close to
     the landing to save them for times when a heavy load was needed at the landing.
     The larger trees were also used as load binders on top of bunks filled with many
     smaller trees. This practice secured the load for travel and improved the load density
     in the clam bunk.

     The production rate of the forwarder is sensitive to the required travel distance. If the
     cutting unit were quite close or next to the landing, the forwarder could be expected
     to move trees faster than the feller-buncher could fell and bunch them; thus, the pro-
     duction rate of the forwarder might far exceed that of the processing system at the
     landing. On the other hand, as the travel distance increases, the forwarder would
     be slower than the feller-buncher; in this case, additional forwarders might be used
     to balance the harvesting operation so that trees arrive at the landing at the proper
     frequency to minimize idle time and delays of other processing equipment. For ex-
     ample, the average forwarding distance for each block during this study was about
     one quarter mile, and the forwarder spent roughly half of its productive time traveling.
     If the forwarding distance were doubled to one half mile, then the relative time spent
     traveling would increase to 67 percent, and the production rate could be expected to
     decrease to about two-thirds of the previous rate.

Table 8 illustrates the operational-time components of the forwarder on each study
block. The information for block A is from a complete time-study log kept by an
observer during the entire study period. The information for block B is based on
observations made during the hourly (random) sample periods. On block B, the time
spent doing other work (primarily road building along the haul route) seemed effec-
tive in improving the production rate of the forwarder, because even though a smaller
percentage of operating time was spent as productive time, a higher production was
achieved on block B. The forwarder experienced occasional delays at the landing,
waiting for the loader to sort and clear previous incoming loads of trees. There were
fewer such delays on block B because the landing-processing system was more
efficient and predictable. Most of the downtime was caused by worn hydraulic hoses
on the grapple boom. The operator replaced three of these while loading trees.

Table 9 shows the relative proportions of productive time the forwarder used to do
separate functions on each of the study blocks. The information is based on observa-
tions made during the hourly (random) sample periods. A higher proportion of time
was spent traveling on block B because the ground was wetter and softer in January
on block B than it was in November on block A. The forwarder was used 75 and
57 percent of the time on blocks A and B, respectively. This reflects unplanned down-
time and use of the forwarder for operations other than forwarding (principally road
building and maintenance on block B) during the harvest. Most of the road-building
time can be attributed to the study being conducted during winter months.

Processing--Observations made during the study resulted in measurements of pro-
duction rates (in tons per hour) for the major components of the processing system.
Trees from block A were processed in November 1986; trees from block B were
processed in January 1987 (refer to table 5 for the production rates). On block A,
loading the magnet chute presented a bottleneck to continuous processing of mate-
rials from the debarker through the shredder. At one time, all on-site loaders (4, in-
cluding the one on the grapple-skidder) were being used to load the magnet chute
and the shredder. At this time a formidable pile of woody debris had accumulated
around the debarker. This debris pile caused delays and downtime for the debarker
and idle time for the chipper.

     Sorting--As the trees were delivered to the landing for processing by the forwarder,
     the mobile loader first set aside the saw logs and then separated the hogged-fuel
     material from the trees that could be processed into clean chips. This sorting process
     progressed rapidly, thereby allowing the loader to attend to its major role of feeding
     the debarker-delimber. Because the mobile loader handled all materials at least
     once, its production rate is based on the weight of all delivered products. Repeated
     handling of individual trees is not considered here. On block A, the production rate
     was 30 tons per productive hour for all functions performed by the mobile loader-
     sorter. The rate increased to 42 tons per productive hour on block B, where the
     material handling conveyor was in full operation.

     During the observation periods, the percent of productive time spent in direct support
     of chips, saw logs, and hogged fuel was as follows: 74:15:12 and 78:12:10 on blocks
     A and B, respectively.

     Clean-chip process--After clearing the incoming trees from the drop zone used by
     the forwarder, the loader moved into position next to the debarker-delimber to assist
     in the clean-chip operation. The loader would then typically feed one or two but
     sometimes as many as four trees into the debarker-delimber. As the cleaned stems
     emerged from the debarker-delimber, they were grabbed by the loading grapple
     attached to the chipper. The chipper operator continued to pull the trees through the
     chain-flail at a rate consistent with proper cleaning. The stems were then placed into
     the feed works of the chipper, which transformed the clean stems into clean chips
     and blew them into a waiting chip van. Bark content of less than 1 percent could
     easily be achieved with this method. The production rate of the chipper is the same
     as the production rate of the debarker in the clean-chip operation because both ma-
     chines process the same trees and the rate is based on the weight of the chips in
     the van. Twice during the study, the debarker was bypassed and the chipper proc-
     essed whole trees into hogged fuel. The chipper's production rate when producing
     hogged fuel was about 50 percent higher than its production rate for clean chips.




24
The production rate of the chipper was limited by the desired cleanliness of chips
produced. The material feed rate of the chipper in linear feet per second was fixed
because the feed rollers are geared directly to the chipping disc drive system. The
chipper's production rate in tons per productive hour can only be increased by feed-
ing larger trees or multiple trees (more basal area through the knives). When multiple
trees are fed through the debarker, however, the effectiveness of the debarking
chains is decreased, which results in higher bark content in the chips. Even though
the debarker is designed to handle multiple stems, the typical load usually consisted
of three or fewer trees during this study. This resulted in chips with a bark content of
less than 2 percent, which was the goal of the operator.

From a block B sample observation of 504 loads of trees fed into the debarker-
delimber, 87 percent of the loads were single trees, 11 percent were two trees at a
time, and 2 percent were three or more trees.

Overall, the production rate of the chipper was 29 and 34 tons of pulp-quality chips
per productive hour on blocks A and B, respectively.

Hogged-fuel process--The prototype shredder normally processed all materials that
were not delivered as saw logs or clean chips into hogged fuel. Materials came from
several sources: very small or unsound trees, repeatedly bucked by the chaser; limbs
and trim ends from saw logs; limbs and broken tops discharged from the debarker-
delimber; bark and fines discharged from the debarker-delimber; bark and other
friable particles discharged by the chipper.

Observations on block B showed that an average of 70 loads per productive hour
were dropped into the shredder hopper. Of these, 56 percent consisted of sawed
stems and branches from the first and second categories above.

A conveyor belt lifted bark and limbs out of the debarker-delimber and discharged
them onto another system 5 of two conveyors that continuously separated the mate-
rials into three categories. Larger limbs usually overshot the second conveyor and
were side cast directly in front of the conveyor that discharged materials from the
debarker-delimber. Fine materials, including most of the bark, filtered down through
openings in the top bed of the second conveyor and were delivered to a third con-
veyor along with any metal chain pieces that occasionally became separated during
operation. Branches that did not filter down through the top bed of the second
conveyor were piled within easy reach of the shredder loading grapple. The third
conveyor then lifted the fine materials and any possible chain particles to a chute that
passed over a 1000-pound permanent magnet. The magnet was designed to trap
chain particles to prevent damage to the sharp knives of the shredder. Fine wood
particles that passed over the magnet were collected in a hopper that was regularly
emptied by the shredder loading grapple, alternately with branches and other debris
as listed above. The shredded hogged fuel was then blown into a waiting van.

5 The second and third conveyors were used on block B but
not on block A. The added material-handling equipment im-
proved production efficiency. Moreover, large quantities of
materials did not accumulate during the day on block B. On
block A, all three loaders were typically used at the end of
each workday to load the shredder until the landing was
cleaned.



                                                                                       25
                         The shredder operator opened the clam-shell doors of the hopper over the shredding
                         drum each time a load was dropped in by the grapple. The doors can be seen in fig-
                         ure 9. Materials from the conveyor system and the saw-log operation were small
                         enough to easily fit into the shredder hopper. The small trees, however, had to be
                         progressively bucked by a chaser with a chain saw to make hopper-length loads
                         (4 to 5 feet long) for the grapple to drop into the hopper. This repeated bucking
                         operation progressed faster than might have been expected because the shredder
                         operator used the loading grapple to move the trees incrementally, in bunches, over
                         a crosswise cull log. This enabled the chaser to buck many trees at a time without
                         moving wood or binding the saw. The result was a clean landing with almost all
                         woody materials being hauled out in a van or on a log truck.

                         The production rate of the hogged-fuel process was calculated based on the weight
                         of hogged fuel leaving the site. The primary machine in the hogged-fuel process was
                         the shredder, which handled all the hogged-fuel materials. The production rate of the
                         shredder was 10 tons per hour on block A and 10.5 tons per hour on block B.

                         Even though materials destined for hogged fuel were also handled repeatedly by the
                         sorter-loader and partially by the debarker-delimber, the chipper, the conveyor-magnet
                         system, and the chaser, the hogged-fuel production rate was attributed to the shred-
                         der because of its singular function. The other systems contributed to the production
                         rate but were not specifically characterized by the amount of their contribution rela-
                         tive to the contribution of the shredder or to the other products they handled. The
                         interrelated functions of the processing equipment make simple assignments of costs
                         equally difficult and arbitrary. No production rate was calculated for the conveyor
                         system, though it clearly processed only hogged-fuel materials.

                         When the chipper was used without the debarker to produce hogged fuel, larger
                         cross-sectional areas of trees (multiple stems) were fed into the chipper, increasing
                         its effective production rate, without concern about bark content. One van on block A
                         was tilled with 47,600 pounds of hogged fuel in 27 minutes, a hogged-fuel production
                         rate of 52.9 green tons per productive hour for the chipper.

Equipment Availability   The results of equipment availability (or reliability) are presented in table 10. The
                         study period was an extremely short time sample for predicting long-term reliability.
                         The observed availabilities are useful for those wishing to accumulate these data with
                         other reported data. All machines experienced relatively high availability, especially
                         considering the minor amount of prior operating time on the three new prototype
                         machines.

                        The availability was higher on block B than on block A for every piece of equipment
                        except the forwarder and the debarker-delimber. The forwarder suffered two hydrau-
                        lic hose failures on block B, and the debarker-delimber was down for over 3 hours on
                        block B with an immobile discharge conveyor. The availability of the shredder was
                        significantly improved on block B. The discharge chute became clogged two times on
                        block A because too much wet material (in the form of old cull logs) was dumped into
                        the hopper at one time. This did not happen on block B, where wet materials were
                        loaded alternately with the other materials. The additional conveyors helped smooth
                        out delivery of fine materials to the shredder, and they separated limbs and fines,
                        giving the shredder operator a selection of materials to load. Because of the material
                        sorting action of the conveyor system, the magnet chute also rarely became clogged
                        on block B.

Productive-Time Ratio   The ratios of productive time are also reported in table 10. These ratios were used
                        for calculating costs and production rates on the common basis of productive hours.
                        The ratios may also be used by planners to estimate scheduled hours required to
                        complete a future job.

                        The feller-buncher worked independently with high availability at a single task.
                        Consequently, the productive-time ratio of the feller-buncher was consistently high.

                        The forwarder had production capacity to spare; therefore, the operator used some
                        idle time to perform other useful work, such as skid road maintenance. This resulted
                        in a relatively low productive-time ratio in spite of high availability.

                        Although the availability of the loader was 100 percent on block B, the loader had a
                        lower productive-time ratio there than on block A. This is a result of the loader being
                        delayed while the belt of the debarker-delimber was jammed.




                                                                                                                27
        Because of the disabling belt jam-up, described earlier, the debarker-dellmber
        lost productive time on block B. The results showed, however, an overall rise in
        productive-time ratio for the debarker on block B. This indicates the overall improve-
        ment in system availability on block B, which had the benefit of two additional con-
        veyors to move woody debris (principally limbs and bark) continuously from the
        debarker across the magnet chute for the shredder.

        The jammed debarker left the chipper idle because it could not operate while the
        debarker was being serviced. Consequently, the productive-time ratio of the chipper
        was lower on block B than on block A. The chipper and the shredder were delayed
        for a few minutes every time a van was filled and an empty van was moved into
        position.        '

        The productive-time ratios for the chipper include the times when the chipper was
        used to produce hp,gged fuel instead of clean chips. The operator chose to do this on
        occasion to meet his hogged,fuel market demand, while balancing the flow of mate-
        rials arriving at the in-woods processing site.

        The debarker was purposely idled for the time when the chipper was producing
        hogged fuel. Oh one occasion on block B, the chipper filled a van with hogged fuel in
        36 minutes. The debarker was not needed for this operation. The debarker was out
        of production for a total of 2 hours and 22 minutes on that occasion to support this
        use of the chipper to produce hogged fuel: 37 minutes to reconfigure the debarker
        (remove its top) to bypass whole trees, 36 minutes to produce the load of hogged
        fuel, 32 minutes to restore the normal configuration, and another 37 minutes of re-
        lated delay before the debarker was restarted. Still, the productive-time ratio for the
        debarker-delimber was higher on block B.

        The productive time ratio of the shredder was higher on block B, primarily because
        the shredder-feedstock handling system was improved by the added conveyors.

Costs   Machine rates were calculated for each piece of harvesting and processing equip-
        ment. The calculations include ownership and operation costs. They do not include
        costs associated with equipment move-in, set-up, overnight maintenance, or road
        and landing construction; company risk and profit are also excluded. Costs for the
        conveyor-magnet system 6 were included, but they accounted for only about $0.06
        per ton of total product. No interest payments are included for the shredder and the
        debarker-delimber because funds for these machines were provided from extemal
        sources. Average yearly investment values were included, however. Machine rates,
        broken down by ownership and operating costs (with the exclusions noted above),
        are shown in table 11.

        The productive costs of harvesting and processing are shown in table 12. These
        costs were calculated by combining the production results of table 5 with the cost
        results of table 11. The total productive cost was $9.52 and $7.80 per ton on blocks
        A and B, respectively.

        8 Conveyors of this type cost about $20,000. They have negli-
        gible operating costs because they are all powered by ex-
        cess hydraulic power from other machinery, and no additional
        operator is required.

a Each entry is based on the green tons of material processed by a particular machine
~for example: whole trees, clean stems, etc.).
  The itemized productive costs of each component of the processing system are not
additive because each machine processesonly a portion of the total product output.
Processing costs were calculated by summing the products of the cost per ton and the
respective tonnage processed by each machine and then dividing that sum by the total
weight of delivered products.




                                                                                                                        29
              The productive costs incurred to process each product (such as, the clean-chip opera-
              tion) are difficult to calculate without arbitrary assignment of the costs of the multiple-
              purpose machines that operate as an integrated system for the good of the entire
              system. Therefore, productive costs of each machine are given (table 12), based on
              the weight of material handled by each machine. Productive costs of the total system
              based on prorated use of each machine for its respective proportion of products
              handled are also shown in table 12. Because the different pieces of equipment proc-
              ess different weights of material, and because some materials may be handled by
              more than one piece of equipment, the productive costs are not truly additive. These
              costs should be considered along with the percentage breakdown of the products
              produced (table 3). It would be incorrect to focus on only one product and attempt to
              isolate the unit cost of that product only. At the study site, all products are delivered
              by the system. Without all products being delivered, a harvest may not be feasible
              because of economics, environmental impacts, or other reasons discussed previ-
              ously. There could be no clean chips without the debarker; no hogged fuel without
              the collective inputs of materials from the sorting, saw log, and chipping operations;
              and no saw logs from these stands without a way to clean the harvest site and
              market the other products.

Conclusions   The steep-slope feller-buncher and clam-bunk-skidder harvesting system was well
              adapted to the stand and terrain conditions of this study. The feller-buncher func-
              tioned remarkably well, with lift capacity, power, and gradability to spare. The clam-
              bunk skidder kept pace with the felling and the processing production rates, with
              extra time to do other tasks such as skid road maintenance. Productive costs for
              harvesting the study blocks were $2.75 and $2.43 per ton on blocks A and B,
              respectively.

              The in-woods, multiple-product processing system demonstrated a consistent ability
              to sort and process the small-diameter trees into a marketable mix of products. All
              machines had high reliability and high productive-time ratios. Average daily produc-
              tion was about three truck loads of logs, eight van loads of clean chips, and four vans
              of hogged fuel. Productive costs for processing the material from study blocks A and
              B were $6.77 and $5.37 per ton, respectively.

              The mobile sorter-loader and the chipper appeared to be sized adequately for this
              application. These are regular, production-line equipment items, and their reliabilities
              were very high even though the chipper had very little operating time on it before
              this study started. The multi-stem debarker-delimber, the shredder, and the magnet-
              conveyor system were designed, fabricated, and used for the first time on this job;
              all worked well. Occasional system clogs were encountered, especially with large,
              unsound cull logs (shredder) or extremely dense crowns (debarker). These clogs
              were all overcome quickly, and the system operated nearly continuously. The added
              conveyors on block B enhanced the material-handling capabilities within the process-
              ing system.

              The chipping operation could not proceed without the mobile loader because the
              loader was needed to insert trees into the debarker; chips were not produced while
              the loader tended to log trucks, for example, but log trucks were usually loaded
              during other slack times for the chipper, such as during knife or van changes. The
              interruptions were minimal, and an additional loader is probably not warranted.

                     The total system-productive costs for harvesting and processing multiple products
                     from the two study blocks in the doghair stand were $9.52 per ton in block A and
                     $7.80 per ton in block B. The weight ratio of chips to total product weight was 53 per-
                     cent on both blocks. Saw logs comprised 16 percent of the product weight on block
                     A and 21 percent on block B. The remaining product was hogged fuel: 31 and 26 per-
                     cent on blocks A and B, respectively. The actual mix of delivered products should be
                     considered simultaneously with the total system-production costs because it is not
                     reasonable to isolate the cost of producing individual products in an integrated sys-
                     tem such as this. The important questions to answer are as follows: Is the system
                     profitable? Would a different configuration be more profitable in this market? Would
                     this or a different configuration be more profitable in a different market?

                     The relatively low productive costs of this system, coupled with short haul, local
                     markets for all three products, and a continuing need for operations in similar stands,
                     combine to make the system feasible. The substantial capitalization costs, however,
                     can be justified only with adequate forest inventories and thorough planning.

                     This system or adaptations of it may be technically and economically suited to har-
                     vest and process other stands of small-d=ameter trees, where total marketing is
                     required to justify any harvest, and where it is desirable to collect the energy-wood
                     component of the stand.

Glossary    C h i p p e r - - A machine with sharp knives used for processing entire stems into pulp
            chips.

           • Doghair--A term used in this report to describe dense stands of small-diameter
             trees that are overstocked and growing very slowly.

            Feller-buncher--A machine used for severing trees from their stumps and arranging
            the severed stems into piles.

            F o r w a r d e r m S e e skidder. The operator generally referred to his skidder as a
            forwarder because of the function it performed. Consequently, the terms are used
            interchangeably in this report, although a forwarder usually transports trees or tree
            segments without dragging any part of the tree.




                                                                                                           35
     Friable--Easily crumbled or pulverized.

     Hogged fuel--Woody biomass that has been processed by a hammer hog, shredder,
     or similar comminution device so that it may be easily handled in bulk and burned for
     conversion into heat energy (also called hog fuel); usually comprised of low value or
     very small-diameter trees, cull logs, branches, and tree tops.

     Landlng--A processing site usually adjacent to both the harvesting area and a
     surfaced roadway, accessible by both highway transport vehicles and forwarding
     equipment.

     Loader--A machine used for lifting and moving trees and tree pads.

     Machine rate--Hourly cost of owning and operating a piece of equipment.

     Productive cost--Cost of owning a piece of equipment per unit of production in
     units of dollars per ton.

     Shredder--A drum-type chipper built by Hermann Brothers for processing limbs,
     bark, small trees, and other woody biomass into hogged fuel.

     Skidder--A ground-based machine that transports trees and tree parts from the
     stump to the landing.

     Supervision rate~A fraction of the total crew wages that is charged to basic super-
     vision of labor and overhead, expressed as a decimal number, where 1.0 means
     100 percent of wages. This rate includes unemployment insurance and other em-
     ployee overhead expenses.

     Time:

     Scheduled: Total work time when the equipment was allocated for operation on the
     study blocks. Scheduled time for all jobs during a year would total the annual-use
     hours for the equipment.

     Operating: The inclusive time between the first moment of productive time until the
     machine shuts down for the day. Operating time includes all productive time, idle
     time, delay time, other work performed, and all downtime (planned and unplanned)
     during the operating day(s). For this study, warm-up and cool-down times and normal
     after-hour fueling and maintenance times were not included in operating time. Oper-
     ating time was recorded by an observer, unlike scheduled time which was estab-
     lished (allocated) before the operation began.

     Productive: Scheduled time less all unproductive time segments, such as idle, delay,
     and down times.

     Idle: Periods of time when equipment could not process material because no mate-
     rial was available from the previous process. (No workload.)




36
Delay: Periods of time when equipment could not complete material processing
because the subsequent process was fully loaded and could not accept new material
(bottleneck ahead).

Down: Periods of time when equipment was unavailable for productive work because
of scheduled or nonscheduled interruptio'.'l of processing owing to mechanical or
operator inability to proceed.

Turn--A complete work cycle, referring to a specific tree-harvesting process, such as
(1) cutting a tree and positioning it on the ground or (2) loading felled trees and
transporting them to a landing.

Forwarding--The process of moving trees and trees parts from the stump to a
landing.

     A study was conducted on the productivity and cost of an integrated harvesting and
     processing system operating in small-diameter timber (western hemlock-type) on the
     Olympic Peninsula of western Washington. The system uses a new steep-slope feller-
     buncher, a clam-bunk grapple-skidder (forwarder), a prototype chain-flail debarker-
     delimber, a chipper, a conveyor system, and a prototype shredder. The study showed
     that the system harvested and processed trees at a combined-system cost of $7.80 per
     green ton at a production rate of 455 green tons per day. The delivered product mix was
     53 percent chips, 21 percent saw logs, and 26 percent hogged fuel by weight. The pro-
     ductivity and machine rate of each piece of harvesting and processing equipment and
     other data are given.

     Keywords: Logging, whole-tree harvesting, feller-buncher, intensive harvesting, utilization,
     integrated harvesting, in-woods chipping, small-tree harvesting.
