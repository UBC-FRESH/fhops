      <abstract>
        <p>This paper describes an approach to the optimal planning of wood harvesting and timber supply for forest companies of Russia. Software and tools successfully used in other countries (e.g., Finland, Sweden, Canada, etc.) are not as effective in Russian conditions for a number of reasons. This calls for the development of an original approach to solve this problem with respect to Russia&#x2019;s specific conditions. The main factors affecting the operation of wood harvesting companies in Russia were determined. The optimization problem was formulated taking into account all important features of wood harvesting specific to the country. The mathematical model of the problem was formulated and analyzed. An important requirement is that the solution algorithm should find high-quality plans within short computation times. The original problem was reduced to a block linear programming problem of large dimension, for which an effective numerical solution method was proposed. It is based on the multiplicative simplex method with column generation within Dantzig&#x2013;Wolfe decomposition and uses heuristics to determine feasible solutions based on the branch and bound method. We tested the solution approach on real production data from a forest company in southern Karelia with a planning horizon up to a year. This case study involved 198 sites and 14 machines harvesting up to 200,000 cubic meters from an available stock volume of about 300,000 cubic meters. An increase in profit by 5% to 10% was observed, measured as revenue from the sale of products, net of harvesting and transportation costs.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Currently, the active use of decision support systems based on mathematical modeling and operations research, along with geographical information systems (GIS), is considered the most effective way to increase production efficiency in the wood harvesting industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-forests-11-00662">1</xref>]. This approach minimizes the harvesting and transporting costs and leads to higher profits, and also improves other production and economic indicators without additional capital costs. Also, a new promising direction for better forest management focused on information and supporting economic, environmental, and sustainable decisions by using high technology sensing and analytical/digital tools, is the precision forestry. A detailed review of the contribution of the GIS, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), and various kinds of sensors to forest operation can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-forests-11-00662">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Wood harvesting and timber transportation in Russia are typically conducted by wood-harvesting companies operating in leased forests. Forest companies have the opportunity to lease free forest areas from the state for up to 40 years, with possible further extension of the lease, subject to all the rules and norms of sustainable forest management. Forest areas are leased on a competitive basis. Preference is given to companies that have all the necessary resources to conduct business and have proven themselves to be responsible forest users during previous periods. If multiple or gross violations of the principles of sustainable forest management are identified, the lease term may be terminated prematurely.</p>
      <p>The supply chain with fully mechanized cut-to-length (CTL) harvesting is used most often. The assortments produced are classified according to their future use, with main groups being sawlogs, pulpwood, energy logs, and logging byproducts. Each group is divided into several subgroups according to their species, qualities, and dimensions. Sawlogs, pulpwood, and energy logs after harvesting are transported by truck or railroad either directly to mills or to intermediate storage areas. The remaining logging residue can be used for the production of bioenergy.</p>
      <p>Wood harvesting in natural stands highly limits the possibility of changing the production volume of particular kinds of products (assortments), as their volume distribution varies according to the harvesting site. Thus, finding consumers for all kinds of harvested products is a challenge. The daily changes in the production spatial structure, natural and production conditions, and consumer demand and other factors necessitate an effective decision support tool for wood harvesting planning. </p>
      <p>To date, many works have been published that describe approaches to solving various problems related to the optimal planning of wood harvesting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-forests-11-00662">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-forests-11-00662">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-forests-11-00662">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-forests-11-00662">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-forests-11-00662">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-forests-11-00662">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-forests-11-00662">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-forests-11-00662">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-forests-11-00662">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-forests-11-00662">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-forests-11-00662">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-forests-11-00662">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-forests-11-00662">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-forests-11-00662">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-forests-11-00662">15</xref>]. The majority of these approaches are based on operations research, because corresponding methods, algorithms, and procedures, when used correctly, can yield notable economic and social effects.</p>
      <p>An overview and comparison of many works related to planning problems and solution methods can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-forests-11-00662">1</xref>]. Early stages were characterized by the use of linear programming (LP) models in forestry planning. In those models, forest management was accounted for in constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-forests-11-00662">15</xref>], but spatial constraints have not yet been considered. However, such tasks in real production conditions have a very large dimension to be solved using the standard simplex method, because with CTL harvesting on hundreds of sites, dozens of product types are produced, and each is assigned to a specific consumer, the number of which is also measured in the dozens.</p>
      <p>A model for harvesting plan optimization with seasonal storage and road network deployment over a 2- to 3-year planning horizon was presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-forests-11-00662">3</xref>]. In that study, the mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem was solved by strengthening the formulation and using Lagrangean relaxation. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that planning of wood harvesting cannot be separated from planning of transportation and road maintenance. A MIP model to solve this multi-element planning problem was proposed by Karlsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-forests-11-00662">8</xref>]. </p>
      <p>Another important challenge is integrating trucks and other modes of transportation, specifically ships and trains. The development of a new decision support system for transportation planning in Swedish forestry is reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-forests-11-00662">7</xref>]. </p>
      <p>Some models were developed to support forest planning taking into account only consumer demand volume, but not prices, harvesting, transportation, and costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-forests-11-00662">12</xref>]. </p>
      <p>Some authors proposed an optimization model that integrates the assignment of machines to harvest areas and schedules the harvest areas during the year for each machine. The assignment problem is solved in phase 1 and the scheduling problem is solved in phase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-forests-11-00662">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-forests-11-00662">9</xref>]. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, in Russia, computer-based decision support tools that automate wood harvesting planning are still used rather seldom. Software and tools successfully used in other countries (e.g., Finland, Sweden, Canada, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-forests-11-00662">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-forests-11-00662">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-forests-11-00662">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-forests-11-00662">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-forests-11-00662">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-forests-11-00662">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-forests-11-00662">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-forests-11-00662">8</xref>] are not so effective under Russian conditions for a number of reasons, including significant differences in legislation and rules governing wood harvesting due to the state ownership of forest lands, the prevalence of natural untreated mixed stands, the uneven distribution of logging operations throughout the year due to seasonal availability of forest areas, own standards for round wood, different categories and generally poor condition of roads, specific organizational structure of wood-harvesting companies, the mixture of different technologies and machinery, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-forests-11-00662">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-forests-11-00662">17</xref>]. The aim of the research described in this paper is to develop an approach to solve the first and one of the most difficult planning problems of a forestry company&#x2014;the optimal planning of wood harvesting and timber supply, subject to aforementioned legislative and technological conditions and limitations specific for Russian forestry companies.</p>
      <p>The paper is organized as follows. We describe the mathematical model and solution algorithm in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-forests-11-00662">Section 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-forests-11-00662">Section 3</xref> contains numerical results of a case study. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-forests-11-00662">Section 4</xref> considers some disadvantages of the approach. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-forests-11-00662">Section 5</xref> concludes the paper.</p>

      <title>2. Materials and Methods </title>
      <p>The following main factors affect the operation of wood harvesting companies in Russia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-forests-11-00662">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-forests-11-00662">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-forests-11-00662">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-forests-11-00662">21</xref>]: </p>
      <p>1. Annual allowable cut (AAC): the annual volume of timber harvested in a leased forest area. Exceeding the AAC is strictly prohibited. It is regulated by state forestry authorities to ensure sustainable forest management; the volume of harvested wood should not exceed the estimated volume of the annual increase in the leased area. The AAC is assigned separately for production and protective forests, for coniferous and deciduous sites, for main and intermediate forest use, etc. All wood-harvesting companies strive to use the AAC to the maximum extent as far as their specific operational conditions allow.</p>
      <p>2. The varying demand for wood harvesting products (assortments) in the operation locality: for example, demand for high-quality roundwood is generally higher than for low-quality firewood, etc. The current forest structure in Russia (natural mixed forests), in which wood-harvesting companies operate, quite often does not match the structure of customer demand. Thus, within the total supply volume there may be a shortage of some assortments and overproduction of others.</p>
      <p>3. Accessibility of harvesting sites. One of the most serious problems of wood harvesting in Russia is the poor development of the forest road network; the average length of forest roads in the Russian Federation is 1.46 km per 1000 hectares, whereas in Western Europe and North America it ranges from 10 to 45 km. As the transporting cost accounts for a significant share of wood harvesting operation costs, it forces companies to determine the maximum distance from roundwood customers within which harvesting is economically feasible. For sites located beyond this distance, harvesting is unprofitable. If a new road must be constructed to access a harvesting site, its construction cost further reduces the cost-effective distance. Thus, forest areas that better match the demand structure may be economically unattractive.</p>
      <p>4. Production facilities: the machinery, equipment, and labor employed by a wood harvesting company. They can be internal or external (hired).</p>
      <p>Thus, to solve the problem of optimal planning of wood harvesting and timber supply on leased forest area, it is necessary to (1) determine the set of sites to be harvested and periods of harvesting on each one within the AAC and use available production facilities; and (2) determine, for each site in the plan, the composition of produced assortments and associate each cubic meter of each assortment to a customer to maximize profit. </p>
      <p>At a tactical level, the typical planning horizon is 1 year. The solution to the problem requires such information as purchase prices for different types of assortments for different customers, harvesting and transporting costs, transporting distance, the accessibility of specific harvesting sites during the planning period, required cutting cycles, and the need for new road construction, among others.</p>
      <p>More specifically, the main initial data for solving the problem include:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A list of harvesting sites with locations, including connections to the road network, and necessary details for calculating the output volume of various assortments. From these sites, the algorithm will select the most profitable for harvesting, ceteris paribus.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Consumer orders including the assortment type, delivery time, and price.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Production facilities that may be involved in wood harvesting and transportation, including all necessary details, the main being productivity, cost, and location.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Various technological limitations: AAC, required cutting cycles, machinery productivity, existing road network, seasonal accessibility of harvesting sites, road closing dates, etc.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>The initial data may be redundant, which is desirable for the problem solution quality. If the total volume of wood in a harvesting site equals AAC, the task will only be able to determine the harvesting periods and transportation routes. If the number of sites is greater, it enables choosing the most suitable ones. The situation is the same with orders and production facilities: if there is a choice, the plan will include orders and production facilities that result in maximal overall operational efficiency.</p>

        <p>Problem (2)&#x2013;(14) is a multicriteria Boolean nonlinear programming problem (BNLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-forests-11-00662">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-forests-11-00662">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-forests-11-00662">24</xref>] of large dimension with linear objective functions (2) and (3) and several nonlinear relationships between parameters (constraints (12) and (13)).</p>
        <p>The large dimension is caused by constraint (9), reflecting the available volume of assortments on harvesting sites, and by constraints (12) and (13), accounting for the time parameters of harvesting sites and required cutting cycles. </p>
        <p>The real production value of a wood-harvesting company (about 3000 harvesting sites per year and 50 different assortments) results in about 160,000 such constraints. </p>
        <p>Note that constraints (10) on the equality of certain variables to zero do not increase the problem dimension. Similarly, constraint (11) does not affect the problem dimension, as it can be accounted for by appropriate correction of the right-hand side vector values.</p>
        <p>One of the supporting optimization subproblems is to find the shortest paths on the road network graph. The following algorithms were tested: Floyd&#x2013;Warshall algorithm, shortest path faster algorithm (SPFA), and Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm with a special pyramid data structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-forests-11-00662">25</xref>]. Expectedly, Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm with a pyramid showed the fastest calculation speed, as a typical forest road network has low density.</p>

        <p>Applying linear programming methods to solving problem (1)&#x2013;(14) is complicated by the following:</p>
        <p>1.&#x2003;Multiple criteria </p>
        <p>The presence of two linear objective functions, ranked in order of priority, adds complexity to the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-forests-11-00662">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-forests-11-00662">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-forests-11-00662">28</xref>]. It happens quite often that higher priority is assigned to a less profitable order of an important client, etc. These criteria will be satisfied as follows: In the first run, we solve problem (2), (4)&#x2013;(14) by finding a set of columns that yield the optimum of objective function (2). Then, on this set of columns, we solve problem (3)&#x2013;(14) to find the solution that yields the optimum of the objective function (3).</p>
        <p>2.&#x2003;Boolean variables and nonlinear constraints</p>
        <p>The multicriteria Boolean nonlinear programming problem is NP-hard, meaning that there are no effective exact solution algorithms of polynomial complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-forests-11-00662">29</xref>].

        <p>Following the Geoffrion scheme in general, the original problem is relaxed by excluding nonlinear constraints and discrete properties, with subsequent solution of the relaxed problem and its correction (in mathematical optimization and related fields, relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-forests-11-00662">30</xref>] is an approximation of a problem by a nearby problem that is easier to solve).

        <p>Observe that the large dimension is mainly caused by constraint (16), reflecting the available volume of assortments at sites. However, the submatrix formed by this constraint has a block diagonal form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-forests-11-00662">37</xref>], where each block corresponds to bounds on assortment volumes for a particular harvesting site. However, these blocks are independent (i.e., the intersection of their column sets is empty).

        <p>In this way, using the block representation of the new relaxed optimization problem (2), (15), (4)&#x2013;(8), (16), (17) and Dantzig&#x2013;Wolfe decomposition, we managed to substantially reduce the problem dimension and obtained problem (22)&#x2013;(25), where (23) is related to the coordinating problem and (24) forms convex hull constraints for each block. In our practical case study presented in the Results section, the dimension was reduced from more than 100,000 constraints to about 150, with about 90 constraints of type (23) and about 60 of type (24).</p>
        <p>We note that the matrix of problem (22)&#x2013;(25) has a large number of columns, but there is no need to consider all extreme points for each block and solve problem (22)&#x2013;(25) explicitly. Instead, it suffices to determine at each simplex method iteration just one point, which yields the maximum of the following LP problem, obtained from the optimality condition of the appropriate block subproblem:<disp-formula id="FD27-forests-11-00662"><label>(26)</label><mml:math display="block" id="mm156"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x2212;</mml:mo><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x2192;</mml:mo><mml:mi>max</mml:mi><mml:mo>;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></disp-formula>

        <p>Therefore, we obtain a supporting optimization problem (26)&#x2013;(28) for the column generation method.

This allows us to account for nonlinear constraints of the original problem when solving the supporting problem in the framework of the column generation method. Thus, LP problem (22)&#x2013;(25) is solved by using the column generation method with supporting problem (26)&#x2013;(28) according to Dantzig&#x2013;Wolfe decomposition.</p>

Thus, there is a need to choose a collaborative harvesting scheme for a block of harvesting sites. This is equivalent to choosing one corner point of the block problem. The corresponding constraint is:<disp-formula id="FD30-forests-11-00662"><label>(29)</label><mml:math display="block" id="mm160"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x3BB;</mml:mi><mml:mi>&#x3C9;</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x2208;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#xA0;</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x3C9;</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x2208;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">&#x3A9;</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#xA0;</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x2208;</mml:mo><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></disp-formula></p>
        <p>To account for this constraint, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on the branch and bound method within the standard scheme for solving integer linear programming problems.

        <p>Thus, the original BNLP is solved by using linear programming algorithms with Dantzig&#x2013;Wolfe decomposition within the column generation method, as well as the modified branch and bound algorithm to choose one corner point of the polyhedron for each block problem.</p>

        <p>A core component of Opti-Wood is an optimization model that takes into account all important features of wood harvesting production in Russia and original optimization algorithms.</p>
        <p>Another main component of Opti-Wood is the road network map with various objects attached to it: harvesting sites, intermediate storage areas, consumer demand points (storage), garages, terminals, quarries, etc. The spatial distribution of accessible harvesting sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="forests-11-00662-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) and other objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="forests-11-00662-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) strongly affects the calculation results. The accessibility of a harvesting site means both transport and organizational accessibility (i.e., the availability of information about the site needed for planning).</p>

      <title>3. Results</title>
      <p>We tested the methods and algorithms on a case study from a forest company in southern Karelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="forests-11-00662-f001">Figure 1</xref>) with a planning horizon up to a year. This case study involved 198 sites and 14 machines harvesting up to 200,000 cubic meters from an available stock volume of about 300,000 cubic meters. The calculation time on a personal computer (Intel Core i7-4790, 3.6 GHz CPU, 16 Gb RAM) in every case was under 5 min. Results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="forests-11-00662-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="forests-11-00662-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="forests-11-00662-t003">Table 3</xref>.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the proposed numerical method and the algorithm implemented based on it raise the profit by 5% to 10% with given harvesting volumes over the annual planning horizon.</p>
      <p>According to our modeling experience, the most significant factors for constructing an effective plan are the spatial locations of sites and consumers and the distribution of wood harvested on a site by product type, which depends on initial stand characteristics. </p>
      <p>According to this optimal harvesting plan, other modules of Opti-Wood software were used to automatically calculate an optimal harvesting schedule, in which particular machinery is assigned to each harvesting site included in the plan for a precise operating period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="forests-11-00662-t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="forests-11-00662-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The objective of this problem was to minimize total machine relocation. A description of the applied heuristic and metaheuristic methods is provided in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-forests-11-00662">10</xref>]. </p>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>The proposed approach allows the creation of cost-effective harvesting plans, taking into account specific features of wood harvesting in Russia. The practical feasibility of the created plans was confirmed by specialists of several forestry companies in Karelia and other regions of Russia.</p>
      <p>As a disadvantage of the approach from the application standpoint, we note that it works with a limited list of harvesting sites and with fairly precise details, but not with the entire leased forest territory. Therefore, the solution is optimal only within the given list of sites. However, this approach is justified in practice, because most Russian companies do not have information about all of their leased forest territory with sufficient detail for adequate decision making. Moreover, this information is not always in digital form. Knowing precise details about harvesting sites is quite critical to ensure good quality of the plan: If incomplete or approximate initial data are supplied, the system would plan sales of nonexistent volumes of products or would not consume all harvested volume. Planning based on more detailed information is the next step toward more precise supply and demand matching. So, this approach stimulates forest companies to verify information about harvesting sites before planning. Forest companies can use all available means of updating information. Whereas state forest inventory is carried out in a certain order, while waiting for their turn, companies often update information by themselves or by involving private contractors that use modern IT to collect and analyze stand data, e.g., data from satellite, airborne, unmanned aerial vehicles, global positioning systems, sensors, devices, analytical and communication tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-forests-11-00662">2</xref>], laser scanning and complex algorithms for processing raw data.</p>
      <p>This work is usually performed gradually over several years. In addition, planning for the whole territory will significantly increase the number of objects, and consequently the calculation time.</p>
      <p>Among other results, the proposed approach allows the identification of sites where harvesting would not be effective in current conditions. With such sites identified, forest management activities may be considered, e.g., thinning, etc. Automation and support of such planning may become one direction for further development of Opti-Wood software.</p>
      <p>The achieved 5% to 10% increase in profit is generally in line with improvement rates reported by several other research teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-forests-11-00662">4</xref>]. It should be noted here that a one-to-one comparison of different approaches is difficult to undertake, since in every case results depend on particular production conditions and the quality of original &#x201C;manual&#x201D; planning. The models described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-forests-11-00662">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-forests-11-00662">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-forests-11-00662">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-forests-11-00662">9</xref>] take into account many factors considered in the proposed model, however, these models fall short in accounting for Russian conditions as they omit such important factors as annual allowable cut, harvesting sites adjacency rules, and seasonal accessibility of harvesting sites.</p>
      <p>As a computational disadvantage of this approach, we note the need to take into account integer convex hull coefficients <inline-formula><mml:math display="block" id="mm166"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x3BB;</mml:mi><mml:mi>&#x3C9;</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#xA0;</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x3C9;</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x2208;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">&#x3A9;</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#xA0;</mml:mo><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x2208;</mml:mo><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> when using the modified branch and bound method. This leads to re-solving the original problem with an additional constraint at each step of the current set partition, which slows the calculation time. A possible remedy is the &#x201C;warm&#x201D; start, i.e., using the already found basis plan with a partial solution of the problem for new constraints. The effect of this modification on the solution quality of the main problem is another further research direction.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This paper describes the developed approach to optimizing wood harvesting planning and distribution of produced assortments between consumer demand points, taking into account a large number of legislative and technological conditions and limitations specific for Russian forestry companies.</p>
      <p>A mathematical model of the problem is formulated and analyzed. This multicriteria Boolean nonlinear programming problem has a large dimension, two linear objective functions, and several nonlinear relationships between parameters.</p>
      <p>The original problem was transformed to a block linear programming problem of large dimension. An effective numerical solution method is proposed based on a multiplicative simplex method with column generation within Dantzig&#x2013;Wolfe decomposition, using heuristics to determine a feasible solution based on the branch and bound method.</p>
      <p>The proposed mathematical model and numerical methods for solving the described problem were implemented in the Opti-Wood software tool and tested on real production data from a forest company in southern Karelia. An increase in profit by 5% to 10% was observed, measured as revenue from the sale of products, net of harvesting and transportation costs.</p>
      <p>Some disadvantages of the proposed approach are discussed, including the need to have a substantial amount of fairly detailed information about harvesting sites and stand characteristics, which is not always fully available. This lack of information is not specific to Russia, but can also be observed in other countries. Some managerial and technological measures are mentioned regarding how to identify and fill in the missing data.</p>
