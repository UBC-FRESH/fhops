# SoftwareX Manuscript Change Log (local)

Track local manuscript edits/text debt without polluting the main project CHANGE_LOG. Update this before each writing push.

## 2025-11-24 – Pending text work
- **Section 5 – Conclusions.** Need a proper summary paragraph (recap FHOPS contributions, automation pipeline) plus future work sentence (BC deployments, forwarder/helper backlog). Currently a placeholder.
- **Metadata narrative.** Introduce the metadata tables in Section 1 or 2 (one paragraph explaining release/version, reproducibility log) so reviewers see context before Table refs.
- **Impact metrics references.** Once GitHub/PyPI stats are pulled, add citations/links to show adoption numbers (stars, downloads) rather than qualitative statements.
