| EBSCO-FullText-2025-11-19.pdf | scanned | Forest Products Journal 60(3) (2010) | Spinelli, Hartsough & Magagnotti aggregated 15 148 cycles from 38 Italian CTL studies (1998‑2008) and derived six regression equations for move/brush/grab/fell/process time (Eqs. 1–6) plus validation stats (r²ₚᵣₑ𝒹 up to 0.67). Inputs cover tree volume, slope, residual/removal density, machine power, carrier/head type, and species dummies; sample productivity curves (Fig. 1) convert the equations to SMH outputs with delay factors (21–50 %). | Prime candidate for a generic harvester/processor helper: implement the per-phase equations, add Italian delay defaults, and expose species/carrier/head toggles so users can benchmark excavator vs. dedicated bases under Mediterranean-like conditions. |

## Next Actions
- Prioritize the Cable Yarding (FNCY) and Advantage issues targeting grapple yarders/swing yarders (e.g., ADV1N5, ADV5N28, ADV7N3) for productivity extraction.
- Process the November 2025 FPInnovations drop in batches:
  1. **Advantage wave** — skim ADV1N12 through ADV9N1 for coastal/interior forwarder or skyline datasets, flagging any explicit regressions.
  2. **Field Notes** — review FNPC17/19/21/28 and FNSF8/9/11/34 for operational nuggets or safety constraints that impact productivity inputs.
  3. **Technical Notes/Reports** — scan TN123–TN296 series plus TR94/109/2017N34/2017N57/2021N93/2023N17 for regression-ready cycle-time, especially anything referencing forwarders or clambunk systems.
- After each batch, update the inventory rows with abstracts + productivity leads, and mirror any forwarder-ready findings into `notes/dataset_inspection_plan.md` (Forwarder coverage section) so we know when the helper module should expand.
- Cross-reference promising reports back into `notes/dataset_inspection_plan.md` under the machine-role roadmap and the productivity registry backlog.
